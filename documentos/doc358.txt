Abstract. We show that the shortestvector problem in
lattices with La norm is NP-hard for randomized reduc-
tions. Moreover we also show that there is an absolutecon-
stant E > 0 so that to find a vector which is longer than
the shortest non-zero vector by no more than a factor of
1 + 2’** (with respectto the Es norm) is also NP-hard for
randomized reductions. The correspondingdecision prob-
lem is NP-complete for randomizedreductions.
1. Introduction. A lattice in R* is the set of all inte-
ger linear combinationsof It fixed linearly independentvec-
tors. T’he question of finding the shortest non-zero vector
in a lattice with repsectto the L, norm was proved to be
NP-hard by Van Emde Boas. However the correspond-
ing problem for the Lz norm (or any other &norms for
1 5 p < OD)remained unsolved. Van Emde Boas con-
jectured almost twenty years ago (cf. [vEB]) that the L2
shortest vector problem for lattices in Z* is NP-hard and
the correspondingdecision problem is NP-complete.
The cr-approximateversion of the problem is the follow-
ing: find a non-zerovector 11in the lattice 1; so that its length
is at most~1]vc]]where~0 is a shortestnon-zerovector of the
lattice. It has been shown by J. Lagarias, H.W Lens&aand,
C. I? Schnorr (cf. [LLS]) that if the cr-appro,ximateproblem
is NP-hard for any Q > nl*a (where n is the dimension of
the lattice) than NP = co - NP. According to recent a
result of 0. Goldreich and S. Goldwasserit is unlikeley that
the a-approximation problem is NP-hard evenfor Q:= $,
since this problem is in NP tl coAM (see [GG]).
In this paperwe show that the shortestvector problem is
NP-hard for randomizedreductions.That is, thereis a prob-
abilistic Turing-machine which in polynomial time reduces
any problem in NP to instancesof the shortestvector prob-
lem. In other words this probabilistic ‘Ruing machine can
solve in polynomial time any problem in NP, provided that
it can use an oracle which returns the solution of the short-
est vector problem if an instanceof it presented(by giving a
basisof the correspondinglattice). We prove the sameresult
about the 1 + 2-*’ -approximate problem where E > 0 is n
sufficiently small absoluteconstantandn is the dimensionot
the lattice. (Recently J.-Y. Cai and A. Nerurkar has shown,
with a modification of the proof presenetedin this paper,that
the factor 1-k 2~*’ can be improved to 1 + It+ (see[CNJ)).
Adleman proved in 1995 (see [Adl]) that factoring inte-
gerscanbe reducedto the shortestvector problem in random
polynomial time, using somevery reasonablebut unproved
assumptions.The work of the present paper has startedas
an attemptto give a proof of Adleman’s theoremwithout the
unprovenassumptions.
Adleman has defined a lattice for his proof, using the
logarithms of primes. This lattice plays a crucial role in our
proof as well. Actually we use a modified and extendedvcr-
sion of the original lattice. Adleman has used his lattice to
factor the integer n. By finding a short vector in the lattice it
is possibleto find supersmoothcongruencesmodulo n,- that
is, different products of primes (not greater than a polyno-
mial of log n) which are congruentmodulo n.
~tn,..., p, be the first m prime numbers,where m is
polynomial in log n. Adleman has defined a lattice V whose
basis vectors are rational approximations of the rows of the
following matrix:
(
d&z . . . 0 M 101~~1
. .. *. .
il
0
. . . ‘/‘F h&gp,
. . . Mlogn 1
The number M is defined so that it balancesthe contri-
bution of the last component to the norm against the con-
tribution of all of the others. The essentialproperty of the
lattice V is that if the length of the shortest non-zero vec-
tor v is below a certain bound and its coefficients in the
given basis are 71, ....~.,,+l and P = n{py I ^/t 2 0},
Q = n(pT I ^/i < 0) then logn+ CE1 logpi is closeto 0,
10
that is TZ~is close to 1 and thereforea = nP - Q is so small
that all of its prime factors are among pl, ,,.,p,. There-
fore from sucha small vector we get a congruencemodule n
amongthe productsof small primes. (An unprovedassump-
tion, formulated in a different more natural way, guarantees
thnt the shortestvector is really below the given bound.)
F’orthe motivation of the defintion of our extendedlattice
we note that if n is squarefree andof the form n = nE”=,p?
then (with the right choice of M) (-71, .... -TV, 1) will be
a very short vector in the lattice. Of course this does not
help much becausein this casewe can find 71, .... 7m easily
without using the lattice, We add a new basis vector to the
lnttice in a way that evenif n haslarger prime factors,but one
of the numbersn-t Zw(w is a fixed intger 1 = 3~1,.... *[nl,
e > 0 ) is good, that is, it is squarefreeand of the form n +
Iw = n&#, then thevector(-71, .... -“/m, 1,Z)isavery
short vector in the lattice. Actually we will be ableto this in a
way that the shortestvector must be of this form if thereis at
leastone good numberin the given segmentof the arithmetic
sequencen + lw. (We will prove that for a random choice
of n, with a suitable distribution, with a positive probability
there is always at least 2”” good numbers.)
It may seemsurprising that the additive structureof the
arithmetic sequencen +lw fits in the multiplicativestructure
of numbersonly with small primes. The reasonis that n+Zw
can be very well approximatedby n( 1+ X)‘, so the structure
is approximately multiplicative. We may consider 1 + z as
a “new prime” and add the correspondingrow to the lattice.
Since finding the shortestvector in this extendedlattice
may be helpful in factoring w (and not n) we change the
notation somewhatin the following definition of the lattice
L, The dimension of the extendedlattice L is larger by one
than the dimension of V and we get it by essentially adding
a new basisvector to the lattice. More precisely the rows of
the following matrix will be the basisof the lattice .L:
i
t/E .,. 0 0 B low1
: ‘. .. ..
il l ., B kp,
0 0..
+-&i :
0
0 0,. 0 ’ I
Blogb
w-” B log(l+ T)
As we will show, with the right choices for the various
parameters,this lattice will havethe following property:
Supposethat ~1, ..... urn+2are the rows of the given ma-
trix and 21= Cgt2 yivi is a non-zero vector of the lat-
tice generatedby ~1, .... urn+2 with +ym+l 3 0 and ~~~~~5
(log b-1-w-l I *, Thenv,+r = Lr1,..., -ymE (0, -1) andif
r”g=l-I,m=lPi theng = b+Zw for someI = 0,&l, .... rt[bc].
We show that the converseof this statementis also true, that
is, if g = b I- lw for someI = 0, fl, ..,, rt[bc] and g is of
the form describedabove then the correspondingvector is
shorter than (log b + w-l)+. It is also true that the length of
every nonzcro vector is at least (log b)*.
The original motivation for the definition of L was the
following. We try to factor the integer w. Let us pick a ran-
dom residueclassd modulo w (which is generatedas a ran-
dom a product of random powers of the primes pl, .... pm.)
After that, we take a representativeb of appropriatesize (a
constantpower of w) from the residue class of d. The im-
portant point is that b does not give any information about
which representationof d (as a product of small primes) is
known to us. Then, by finding a short vector in the lattice,
we could get a congruenceb s nE”=, pp’ (mod w). By
taking enoughdifferent numbersb we could get enoughcon-
gruencesto factor w. The problematicandstill not completed
part of this direct reduction of factoring to the shortestvector
problem,is to guaranteethat for a b generatedby this distri-
bution therewill be a good numberin the arthmetic sequence
b + kw, 1 = 0, fl, .... f[bc]. While trying to fill this gap in
the proof we noticed that there is another distribution for b
where it can be proved easily that with a probability of at
least 4 there are always good numbersin the given segment
of the arithmetic sequence. Namely b will be the product
of h distinct elementsof the set (PI, . . ..p.,,}, for a suitably
chosen fixed h, with uniform distribtuion on the set of all
products with this property. (In this casethe number b re-
veals its known expressionas the product of small primes,
so we cannotgauranteethat we get enoughindependentcon-
gruencesfor factoring.) However, for this distribution, we
havethat with a probability of at least 4, the lattice L has an
exponentialnumber of vectorstl with ~~u~~2< log b + n”.
At this point in the attemptedproof we haverealized that
the lattice L can be used to prove the NP-hardness of the
shortestvector problem (even in an approximatesense)for
randomizedreductions.Namely the lattice has the nice prop-
erty that it hasa basiswhereall small vectorshave0,l coeffi-
cients only (with the exceptionof the last coefficient), more-
over the numberof vectorsthat are small enoughto havethis
nice property is exponential (in the dimension of the lattice.)
This createsa possibility to reduce the subsetsum problem
to the shortestvector problem. (The NP-completeness of
the subsetsum problem was proved by Karp (see[K])). We
will look for a solution of the subset sum problem among
the coefficiemtsequencesof the short vectors. Although not
every 0,l sequencewill occur as a coefficient sequence,still
the numberof different 0,l coefficient sequencesis exponen-
tial in the size of the subsetsum problem. This will make it
possible to find the solution of the subsetsum problem em-
beddedin some way into a coefficient sequenceof a short
vector.We will be able to searchamongthesecoefficient se-
quencesfor a solution of the subsetsum problem, by embed-
ding our lattice L into anotherlarger dimensional Euclidean
spaceandthereforechangethe length of its vectors.Accord-
ing to this new (~52)norm every short vector will be short in
the original sensetoo, but they also have to satisfy somead-
ditional requirements.By defining the embeddingin a suit-
able way this additional requirement can be that the coeffi-
cient sequence(in somemodified form) is a solution of the
11
subsetsum problem. Therefore,by finding the shortestvec-
tor in the embeddedlattice (or one which is approximately
the shortest with an exponentially small error) we will be
able to solve the subsetsum problem.
As we mentioned above, at somepoint in the proof, we
have to make a transition from an exponential number of
0, l-sequences(coefficient sequencesof short vectors),to all
0,l sequencesof a certain length, becauseotherwisewe can-
not guaranteethat the solution of the subsetsum problem is
amongthem. As a model for such a transition we use a the-
orem of Sauerabout hypergraphs. (This theorem is related
to the notion of VC-dimension. We cannot use the theorem
itself in the proof becauseit is not constructive enough,but
we give a constructiveanalogueof it, at leastin a probabilis-
tic sense.) Sauer’stheorem (we give the exact statementin
the next section), statesthat if a set X is a set of subsets
of the set S and 1x1 is abovea certain bound dependingon
ISI and I: then there is a Y c X, IYl = 12so that every
subset of Y occurs among the sets Y rl 2, 2 E X. We
may think that S is the basisof the lattice (excluding the last
esceptional basis vector) and for each short vector w in the
lattice we have T, E X, where T, is the set of elementsof
S where the correspondingcoefficient of v is 1. (All of the
other coefficients are 0.) Therefore the theoremgaurantees
that there is a subsetY of the basisvectorswhere we get all
0, l-sequencesascoefficient sequencesof short vectors.We
may look for the solution of the subsetsum problem among
the 0, l-sequencesdefinedon Y. (Sauer’stheoremalso guar-
anteesthat IY I is large enough.) The only problem with this
approachis that we do not haveany methodwhich could find
such a Y in polynomial time. A randomchoice for Y is not
satisfactorybecauseX can be unevenly distributed in S. We
formulate an analogueof Sauer’stheorem where a random
Y is a good solution with a probability close to 1. Namely
instead of taking a single subsetY we will take a sequence
of pair-wisedisjoint subsetsC = (C;, .... Ck) and for each
T E X we define a function f~(i) = ITrl Gil on {l, .... k}.
We show that if every elementof X is of the sameappropri-
ate size, 1x1 contains sufficiently many setsand we take the
sequenceCl, .... Ck at random,then with a probability close
to one we get every 0,l functions on (1, .... k} in the form
of f~ for a suitable T E X. Theorem2.2 in the next section
is an esact formulation of this statement.The proof of this
theoremis the technically most difficult part of our paper.
There is a third part of the proof, the embeddingof L into
anotherEuclidean spacewhich definesa new norm on it. We
may think that we do this by simply adding new columns to
the matrix defining the lattice L. E.g. if we would want to
guaranteethat from a shortestvector v = CL”=, wvi we get
the solution of a subsetsum problem xzl ai~ci = b in the
form ai = ‘yi, i = 1, .... m, then we can add a last column
to the matrix whose elementsare -alK, .... -u&, bK, 0.
With the right choice of the number K we get that if there
is a solution of the subsetsum problem of the form xi = vi,
then the shortestvector in the extendedlattice 1;’ (that is in
the lattice whosebasisconsistsof the new longer rows), must
provide such a coefficient sequence+yi. Of course this is an
idealized situation, becausein general we do not get every
0,l sequenceof length m in the form of 71, ,.., y,n from a
short vector w. However combining this idea with the de-
scribed generalization of Sauer’stheorem we can conclude
the proof. (SeeLemma 2.2 and Corollary 2.2 for an exact
formulation of the related results. Corollary 2.1 is only in-
cluded as an illustration basedon the simplified picture de-
scribedabove.)
We have describedthree parts of the proof, and as we
have said, the second one, the constructive annlogue of
Sauer’stheorem, is the most difficult in a technical sense.
Still we feel that the most difficult step in the proof was to
find the three different parts which together imply our main
result and not the proofs of the individual components.
Both the choice of the lattice L and the choice of the
sequenceCl, .... Ck which determinesthe lattice L’ is prob-
abilistic. In the defintion of L we choose the number b at
random, with a given distribtuion, and we are able only to
prove that the lattice L hasthe required property with a prob-
ability greaterthan 8. (For the proof that L is good for every
choice of b we would needvery strong statementsabout the
uniformity of the distribution of numberswith small prime
factors.)The secondpart of the proof, the construction of L’
through Cl, .... Ck is also probabilistic. Still there is a pos-
sibility that a single sequence4, .... C& selectedat random
canbe replacedby a polynomial numberof deterministically
constructedsequencesso that for eachfixed subsetsumprob-
lem at least one of them is good.
Remarks, 1. Adleman has defined the lattice V, so that
the coordinatesof the basisvectorsarerationals, they are ap-
proximations of the coordinatesof the rows of the first ma-
trix. This way it is possibleto perform a computation whose
input is the lattice. We define the lattice L as a lattice in
Rm+2, that is, the coordinatesof the basis vectors can be
irrational. We will prove all the necessaryproperties of the
lattice L, and then show that L can be approximnted by a
lattice x C Qm+2 (that is, the basis vectors of E has ratio-
nal coordiiates) and show that 1 still has the nice properties
of L that are neededfor the rest of the proof. Unfortunately
both approachescreatetechnical difficulties.
2. The lattice L has been originally defined for a com-
pletely different purpose than its final use in this paper.
Therefore it may easily happenthat other, perhapsin some
sensesimpler, lattices also have the properties that are re-
quired from L to completethe proof. In the next section we
collect these properties in Lemma 2.1. There are different
reasonswhich may motivate the searchfor such a lattice: to
make the proof deterministic; to improve the factor in the
approximationresult; to makethe proof simpler.
3. As we havedescribedabovewe breakdown the proof
into three different parts. We tried to makethe various parts
independent,so in eachpart we areusing aslittleinformation
from the other parts aspossible. E.g. we formulate what arc
12
the important properties of the lattice 1; and then use only
thesepropertiesin the other parts of the proof.
4, There arc many related problemsto the shortestvec-
tor problem, the nearestvector problem, the nearestcode-
word problem etc. (for the definitions seee.g. [ABSS]). Van
Emdc Boas hasproved the NP-hardness of the nearestvec-
tor problem in all L,, norms 1 5 p 5 co. Arora, Babai,
Sternand Swecdyk(cf. [ABSS]), hasshown that evento ap-
proximate the nearestvector within a constantfactor is NP-
hard. A, Vardy has proved recently (cf. [Vl] or v2]) that
deciding whether thereis a codewordwithin a given distance
ia NP-complete. More detailed information can be found
about theseand other related problemsin [ABSS] or yV2].
5, The motivation for proving that to find short vectors
in lattices is hard, in some sense,comespartly from cryp-
tography. (See [Ajtl], [AD], [GGHl], [GGH2] ). There
arc cryptosystemswhosesecurity is basedon the assumtpion
that to lind short vectorsin lattices is computationally infea-
siblc, Since these assumptionsimply the hardnessof even
an approximation of the shortest vector upto a polynomial
factor, we cannot really hope to prove their HP-hardness,
since, as WCnoted earlier, it would imply NP = co - NP,
nt least if the exponent is larger than .5. Still, the fact
that closely related lattice problems are NP-hard, makes
the hardnessassumptionsof the cryptographicsystemsmore
credible, Therefore it would be particularly important to im-
prove the ar-approximateversion of our theoremby proving
it for greatervaluesof cI1.
2, The outline of the proof. In this section we break
down the proof of our main result (the theorembelow) into
csscntislly threedifferent lemmataand show how they imply
the theorem, (A full, detailed proof of each lemma is given
in [Ajt2],)
Thcorcm 2.1, The shortestvectorproblem in 1;~ is NP-
hard for randomized reductions. Moreover there is an ab-
solute constant E > 0 so that the (1 + 2+‘)-approximate
shortestvector problem is also NP-hard for randomizedre-
ductions,
WCprove the NP-hardness (for randomizedreductions)
of the shortestvector problem. We get the approximatever-
sion by minor modifications of the proof.
We will consider probabilistic ‘luring machinesthat are
using nn oracle which returns a solution of the shortestvec-
tor problem (in 1;~) if a lattice is presentedto the oracle
(representedby a basis), We will show that the subsetsum
problem can be solved in polynomial time by such a ma-
chine, Since the subset sum problem is known to be NP-
complete this will imply that the shortest vector problem
is NP-hard for probabilistic reductions. The subset sum
problem can be formulated in the following way: assume
that al , .,,, al, b arc integers, and we are Iooking for a so-
lution of the equation &, ajai = b where ZENE (0,l)
for i = 1, .,,, t. We define the size of the problem as
logz(l6l + 1) + 1 + &, log2(larl + 1). We will not use
the subsetsum problem directly but we will use a special
caseof it, which is still NP-complete.
Definition. The restricted subset sum problem.
Suppose that al , .... or, b are integers, max(log2(]bl -i-
l), ma& log,(]ail + 1)) < l3 and we arelooking for a so-
lution of the systemof equationsciZI ajz; = b, cf=, 2i =
[!J where zi E (0,l) for i = 1, .... 1. The size of the prob-
lem is P(l + 1).
It is easy to reduce the subset sum problem to the re-
strictedsubsetsumproblem, that is, the restrictedsubsetsum
problem is also NP-complete.
We will consider problems whose inputs are lattices
given in Q” where Q is the field of rational numbers. The
lattices will be presentedby a basis. So, to define the size of
the problem, we have to define the size of a basis.
Definitions. 1. If ~1, .... a, are linearly independent
vectors in Rm for some rn 2 n, then we call the set
{E"=, cwi I QIl,..., Q~are integers 3 a lattice. (Sometimes
the defintion is given with the additional requirementrn = la.
Since the real subspacegeneratedby L can be isometrically
embeddedin Rm the two definitions are not essentially dif-
ferent.)
2. If r = t is a rational number, so that (p, Q) = 1,
then size(r) = log,(]pl + 1) + log,(lql -i- l), size(O) = 1.
If v = (r1 , ... . r,) E Q” then size(v) = Cy=‘=1size(ri).
If v1, .... vt is a sequenceof vectors then size(vl, .... vt) =
gzl size(vi).
3. ~~v~~will denotethe La norm of the vector v unless it
is explicitly statedothenvise.
The motivation for the following lemmais to makesome
connectionbetweenthe shortestvector problem and the sub-
set sumproblem. The essenceof the lemma is that that there
exists a lattice in Q” where all of the nonzerovectorswhose
length does not exceed a certain limit has only 0,l coeffi-
cients in a fixed given basis, (with the possible exception of
the last coefficient for each vector). Moreover the number
of vectors below this limit is exponential in the dimension
of the lattice. Later we will look for the solution of a sub-
set sum problem amongthe 0,l sequenceswhich occur as a
coefficient sequenceof such a short vector. By embedding
the lattice (linearly but not isometrically) into Qfi for some
iFL> m, that is defining a new Euclidean norm on it, we will
be ableto gauranteethat the shortestvector in the new lattice
has a coefficient sequencewhich provides a solution for the
subsetsum problem.

h1oreoverthere is a probabilistic Turing machine which
for each input n gives the following output in time poly-

with a probability of at least 4 if L is the lattice generated
byvl, ,.., Urn+2 then m, p, Vi, . . . . vm+2,L satisfy conditions
(1),(2),(3),~4),(5),(6).
Our next goal is to define an embedding of the lattice
L (given by the previous lemma) into a higher dimensional
spaceso that any shortestnonzerovector of the new embed-
ded lattice (which hasa different metric sincethe embedding
is only linear but not isometric), has a coefficient sequence
(in the embeddedimage of the basis (Vi}) which provides a
solution of the subsetsum problem. Under certain additional
assumptionswe will be able to do this asour next lemmawill
show.
Definitions. Assumethat m, p, ‘~1,.... vm+z, L are fised
with the propertieslisted in Lemma2.1.

that we do not use the last component of o in this defini-
tion.) Supposethat m’ is a positive integer and A is a matrix
with m’ rows and m + 1 columns. If z E Rm+2, then let
$4(z) be the m + 2 + m’ dimensional vector (z, AA(z)).

w E LtA), at least one of the vectorsw, -w is in LtA)+.
Lemma 2.2. Assume that cl, ~2,ca,cq are fixed with the
properties in Lemma 2.1, c5 > 0, n is sufficiently large,

with absolute values no larger than ncs. If there is a v E 5’1,
so that IIAA(v)ll” = min{llAA(~)~~2~z E S2) and w is a
shortesr nonzero vector of L(“) with w E LIA)+, then there
is a u E 5’2 so that llAA(~)lj = llAA(v)ll and w = $A(%).
Definition. Assume that Y C {l, ....m). Y =

properties given in Lemma 2.1. For each v E L, u =

for all i E (1, .... I).
In the following Corollary we consider the subset sum
problem without the additional restriction xgl zi = [Q],
This Corollary and the following Theorem are not parts of
our final proof. We use them only to illustrate the main idea
of the proof in a much simpler setup.

Supposethat x:=1 ai = b is a-n instance of the (not re-
stricted) subsetsum problem SO that 0; = gy,,,(i) i = 1, .... I
is a solution of the problem for some v E 5’1, and Ir’ > 0
is sufficiently large. Let D = {&,j)i=l j-1,, - a.*,m+l bc the (1

dl,m+l = -Kb, and dl,i = 0 for all other j. Ifw E LtD)+

Zj = gy+(i), i = 1, .... 1is a solution of the given instance
of the subsetsumproblem.
We do not prove this Corollary, since it is not part of
our proof, but it easily can be proved even without Lemma
2.2. According to this Corollary we are able to solve the
non-restricted subset sum problem by solving the shortest

Definition. Assumethat S is a finite set, X is a set of
subsetsof S. The pair (S, X) is called a hypergraph.
Theorem (Sauer). If (S, X) is a hypergraph and 1x1 >
Cf=;’ (If’) h tht en ere is a Y E S with b elementssuch that
every subsetofY occurs among the sets Y fl 2, Z E X.
For each v E Sl, v = Czt” yivi let TV = (i 5 m 1
% = 1). We apply Sauer’stheorem with S = (1, .... m},
X = {T,Iv E Sl). We have that ISI < nc’ and by (1) and
(4) of Lemma 2.1 1x1 2 2CJn10gn.Since 2 < n&,0 *: 6 < 1
and n is sufficiently large with respect to cl and S the re-
quirements of Sauer’stheorem are met with b 3 1. (In-
&d ‘& (If’) <l(nQ)’ <e610~nen6clloen <2Can*oEn,)
Therefore there is a set Y ,C S, IYl = I so that every 0,l
function on Y is of the form gy+ for some v E Sl. This
clearly implies that the solution of the subsetsum problem
is among them. (The requirement 1 < n8 does not cause
any problem since if 2 is given and we pick the smallest n
with I < n6, then the correspondingbasis of the lattice L
will bestill polynomial size in 1.) Sauer’stheoremtherefore
guaranteesthe existenceof the required setY, but it doesnot
provide any way for finding it (finding Y in polynomial time
would be necessaryto completethe proof this way). Unfor-
tunately the proof of the theorem is not contstructive (from
14
our point of view), To be able to use the describedapproach
WCgeneralizethe theorem,namely we replacethe setY with
n more complicatedstructure in a way that makesthe proof
mom constructive.
First we note that it would be sufficient for our proof if
a randomchoice of Y would satisfy the requirementsof the
theoremwith a positive (polynomially large) probability. (In
this caseby taking many randomchoicesof Y we could get
at least one which is good for our purposes.)Unfortunately
this is not true if Y is uniformly distributed, since X can be
concentratedon a small subsetof S. In order to avoid this
difliculty, instead of taking a subsetY with I elements,we
will take a sequenceof disjoint subsetsCl, ... . Cl eachwith
P elements,where T will be a suitably chosenpositive inte-
ger. Now our goal is to get such a sequenceCl, .... Cl so
that for every O,l-function f on (1, ....I} there is a T E X
with f(i) = ICi rl TI for i = 1, ....Z. The original setup
can be considered as a special case of this, namely when
each C{ has exactly 1 clement. We will formulate an ana-
logue of Snucr’stheoremwith this new representationof the
0, l-functions, We need some additional restrictions on the
hypcrgraph (S, X), (which will hold in our case). Among
other conditions we will assumethat all of the setsin X has
the samenumber of elements. This is not a real restriction
sinceif X is of exponentialsize(in n) andS is of polynomial
size then X always has a subsetof exponential size which
contains sets of the same cardinality. Fixing this common
oisrehelps to fnd the right choice for the other parametersin
the theorem,
Defmition. A hypergraph (S, X) is called n-uniform if
~T~=nforallT~X.
Theorem 2.2. For all ~1 > 0, or2 > 0 there exist 0 <
61 < 1, 0 < 6s < 1,0 < Sa < 1 so that for aJJsufficiently

WCwill USCthis theoremto completeour proof. First we
formulatean analogueof Corollary 2.1 which is also a corol-
lary of Lemma2,2 but will be usedtogetherwith Lemma2.2
(insteadof Saucr’stheorem). In this Corollary we will con-
sidcr the restrictedsubsetsum problem.
Dcllnitions. 1. Assume that C = (Cl, .... Cl) is a se-
quenceof disjoint subsetsof (1, .... ml and L, ~1, .... wm+2
arc given with the properties describedin Lemma 2.1. For
cnch ‘u E L, 21= C;n=?;2~iyi’u;,gc+, will denote a function
defined by ga,u(i) = xjeoi Tj-
2. Let D = (4~)r=1,,,,, ~-2, j=l,..., m+l be a ma-ix with
1I- 2 rows and m -l- 1 columns,defined by
(1) 4,j = ail3 for all j E Ci, &,,,,+I = -b13 and
dlj = 0 for all other valuesof j
(2) da,j = I3 for all j = uf-, Cj, ~Ja,~+l= -[$a3 and
d2,j = 0 for all other values of 7,
(3) For all i = 1, .... I, d&j = 1 if j E Ci and &+ad =
0 otherwise
If Cl, ...) Cl are consecutiveintervals of (1, .... m} then D is
the matrix on the top of the next page.
Corollary 2.2. Assume that cl, ... . c5, m, p,
211,.... v,+2, L are as in Lemma 2.2, I is an integer witi
l_<Z~mandC=(C~,..., Cl), is a sequenceofpahwise
disjoint subsetsof (1, ....m}. Supposethat Cfzl cai = b
is an instance of the restricted subsetsum problem so that
Xi = g+(i), a’ = 1, .... I is a solution of the problem for
somev E Sl. Let D be the (I + 2 by m + 1) matrix defined
above. Ifw E L(“)+ is a shortestnonzero vector in L(“),
anduI = $D(u), hen 2; = SC,=(i), i = 1, .... I is a solution
of the given instanceof the restricted subsetsumprobJem.
Now, accepting Lemma 2.1, Lemma 2.2, Corollary 2.2
and Theorem 2.2 we can prove our main theorem. We de-
scribe a probabilistic algorithm V using an oracle which
gives a shortest vector of the lattice presentedto the ora-
cle. Each use of the oracle will be counted as 1 time unit.
V will find a solution of the restricted susbetsum problem
cf=, aixi = b (provided that such a solution exists) in time
polynomial in I, with a probability exponentially close to
one,
Assumenow that an instance cf,, &xi = b of the re-
stricted subsetsum problem (which has a solution) is given
as an input. Let cl, ~2,ca,c4 be the constantswhose exis-
tenceis statedin Lemma 2.1. Let Sl, 62,153be the numbers
whose existenceis guaranteedby Theorem 2.2 with cyl --P
2~1, era + ca. Finally let n = r&l. We apply Lemma
2.1 for this n. According to the lemma p, m, ~lr, .... v,+a
can be computedin time polynomial in n, and so in I too,
with the propertieslisted in the lemma. (More precisely this
happenswith a probability of at least 3 only. So we will per-
form the algorithm describedbelow for the given values of
p, m, ~1, .... v,+s, if we do not get a solution of the subset
sum equation we repeat it with other random values. Per-
forming this a polynomial number of times, with a probabil-
ity exponentially close to 1 it will happpenat at least once
thatp,m,vr ,..., ~,+a satisfy the conditions of Lemma 2.1
). We take a random sequenceC = (Cl, .... Cl) of pari-
;iS,e disjoint subets of S = (1, ....m} each with exactly
n-1-6a] elements,with uniform distribution on the sets
of all sequenceswith theseproperties. Clearly this random-
ization can be easily performed by picking the sets Ci re-
cusrsively. n = r&l implies that I < [n”‘] therefore
we may apply Theorem 2.2 with al --P 2~1, CY~+ ca,

!I’ E X. If this is the casethen there is a T E X so that
pi = ]Ci tl TI is a solution of our subsetsum problem. (We
have assumedthat there is a solution). By the definition of
X and gc,il we have that there is a II E Sl so that pi = gcly
is a solution of the subsetsum problem. We may apply now
Corollary 2.2 and get that if w E .LtD)+ is a shortestvec-
tor in dD) and w = &(u), then oi = QCp i = 1, ..,l
is a solution of our susbetsum problem. 2, may find such
a w by asking the oracle for a shortest vector in .L(“). D
presentsthe lattice LtD) to the oracle by the basis $D(ui),
i= 1, .... m. (By the definition of ?c,D the size of this basis
is polynomial in 1.) The oracle gives a shortestvector w’ in
L(D) since either w’ or -w’ is in LID)+, ‘D finds a w with
the required property. Writing w as a linear combinationsof
the vectorsvi andusing the fact that $D is a homomorphism,
2, finds the vector u E L and so the solution of the subset
sumproblem. This way the algorithm has found the solution
only with a probability 1 - n-63. Repeatingthis a polyno-
mial number of times independentlywe may ensurethat the
probability of successis esponentially close to one.
The proof of Theorem 2.2. We give only a sketch of
the proof and a few details. The full proof is available in
[Ajt2]. (The numbering of lemmatahere is identical to the
numberingin the full version.)
Definition. Assumethat (S, X) is a hypergraph. (S, X)
will be called (Al, a, b)-dispersed,if I(2 E XIB 2 T}I <
&nf holds for all i = 0, 1, .... X:andfor all B C S, JBj = i.
If 2 C S then we will say that (S, X) is (itf, CY,k)-dispersed
on Z-if I{?’ E XIB C_ T)I < CZ-~M holds for all i =
011, .... b and for all B 5 2, Il3I = i.
Remark. If S is the set of primes pi, ....pL (as defined
in Lemma 3.2) and X consists of those subsetsT C S
with I”IPETp E I where I is a fised interval, then X will
hwe very strong dispersion properties in the sensedefined
above. Namely if B C S then we have (appro?rimately)that
I(T E X I B E T)I 5 111nPeTp-l. We do not utilize this
property in our proof of the NP-hardness result (although
it was used in an earlier version of the proof). Theorem2.2
does not assumeany dispersion property of the set X, we
have assumptionsonly about its cardinality. (We will show
that there is large a subsetof X with nice dispersion prop-
erties.) Taking into account the dispersionpropertiesof the
hypergraph defined from the primes and adding the corre-
sponding condition to the assumptionsof Theorem 2.2 is a
possibility for improvments. (It may result only in better
constants.)
Sketchof the proof of Theorem 2.2. We will randomize
the setsCl, .... ck sequentially.The elementsof the individ-
ual sets0; will be also randomizedsequentially, more pre-
cisely in bigger blocks. After eachrandomization we count
the number of sets T E X which intersect the already ran-
domized(or partially radnomized)setsC!i in a given number
of elements, The “given number” will be only 0 or 1. In
other words assumethat f is a fixed 0, l-function definedon
L, and supposethat Cl, .... C+1 has been already random-
ized and Ci partially randomized(Cl will denotethe part of
C?iwhich has been already selected). We count the number
of T E X with f(j) = ICj n TI for j = 1, .... i - 1 and
f(i) = ICl n TI. We prove the theorem by showing that
with a high probability this number g is always close to its
expectedvalue. More precisely this will not be necessarily
true for our original set X but we show that X has a subset
X’ with nice dispersionpropertieswhich still hassufficiently
many elements(Lemma5.2) and for such an X, g and its cx-
petted value will be always close.
Without somedispersionproperty we cannot expect that
sucha statementis true. Indeed assumethat all of the setsin
X contain a single point a E S. If a is selectedas a meme-
ber of a Cj then automatically IT n Cjl $ 0 for all E X
although the expectednumber of such sets T E X can be
quite large. Thereforewe need an assumtpionthat the num-
ber of setsin X containing any fixed point of S is not too
large comparedto 1x1 (lessthan a polynomial fraction). Ac-
tually we will use a similar assumptionabout the cardinality
of setscontaining two fixed points, This is equivalent to the
statementthat X is (1x1, n-“, 2) dispersed.Even if we start
with such an X our proof may breakdown, becauseafter se-
lecting Cl, .... Ci we will need that if we replace X by Xi
the set of all T E X with f(j) = IT n C.jl for j = 1, .... i,
then Xi has the samedispersionproperty. Unfortunately the
Wb- a, 2) dispersion property is not inherited this way.
(We will not have a similar problem while selecting the el-
ementsa single set C; becauseduring this processwe mea-
sure the error relative to the size of X at the beginning of
the selection process.)Assumenow that X is (1x1, n’“, 1)
dispersed,for somepositive integer 1 and let’s seewhat hap-
pens during the choice of Cl. If we are able to prove that
16
the numberg is close to its expectedvalue using that X is s
WI, n-, 2) dispersed,then we may apply the sameproof
to the subsetof X containingl - 2 fixed points. (This subset
in (1X1,n’“, 2) dispersed,) This way we get (approximat-
ley) that X1 is (IXlI,n-*, 1 - 2) dispersed. Continueing
selectionsof the setsCi we get that Xi is (IXil, nea, I - 24
dispersed,Lemma5.2 guaranteesthe dispersrionproperty of
the r;electcdX’ C X with a large I, so during the selections
of the setsCi, Iwill decreasebut it will remain alwayslarger
thnn 2.
The subsetX’ selectedin Lemma5.2 hasaspecial struc-
ture, namely all of it setscontain a common subsetB with
nt most (1 - P)n elcmetnsfor someconstant0 < /3 < 1. In
the rcmnining part of the proof we will consideronly setsCi
which hasan empty intersectionwith B. Sincethe probabil-
ity thnt B tl U Cf = 0 is at least 1 - n-6 for someconstant
6 > 0 it doesnot causeany problem. End of sketch.
WC formulate now another weaker version of Theorem
2,2 where the statementsare made only about hypergraphs
(ISl,X) that are (IXl,n-a, n) dispersedfor someconstant
cy,Wealso give someindication aboutthe choiceof the num-
bers61,i = 1,2,3. Later we show that this waekerversion
implies the original theorem.

We will show that this lemma implies theorem2.2. The
following lemmais neededfor this proof.
Lemma 5.2, For aJl~1 > 0, (~2> 0 there exist a p > 0

sumetbnt (S, X) is an n-uniform hypergraph,ISI 5 nal and

lhen IX’1 > 2onlogn and (9,X’) is an n - IBI-unifbnn
(IX’], n-P, n - IB I)-dispersedhypergraph.
Proof, Assume that p > 0, is sufficiently small with
rcopcct to ry1 and cy2. Let B E X be maximal with the
following property:
(5.1) I(T E X 1B c T)I > n-@lBllXI.
We claim that IBI 5 (1 - p)n. Indeed, otherwise the
number of elementsof X containing B is at most ISlfl* 5
(nal)B* = 2Sal*log*. The definition of B implies that
this number is at least IXln-fl* > 2aan*ogn-~n*ogn =
2h-BWw. We got 2( aa-B)*lofi < 2h*log*. This
is a contradiction since@is sufficiently &all with respectto
w,a2.
Now we show that B satisfies the conditions of the
lemma. According to (5.1) IX’1 > n-BIB1 1 n-fin >

not (IX’l, n-p, n- IBI)-dispersed.Then there is a D E IX’1

have that B U T’ E X. Therefore if B’ = B U D then
I(T E X 1B’ E T}I 2 IX++ 1 n-@I+@j = n-@lB’I
in contradiction to the maximality of B. Q.E..D.(Lemma5.2)
Now we show that Lemma5.1 implies Theorem2.2.
We apply Lemma 5.2 to the hypergraph (S, X) of theo-
rem 2.2. Let (S’, X’) be the hypergraphdefined in Lemma
5.2. We have that it is (IX/l, n-p, n - IBI)-dispersed and
IX’] > 2@*l”gn. Let m = n - IBI. We may formulate some
cons&ences of thesepropertiesin terms of m. We get that
IX’1 2 2pm*ogmand (9,X’) is (IX/l, n-g, m) dispersed
(sincem 2 j3n 2 nf).
Now we may apply Lemma5.1 to the hypergraph(S, X),
with n + m, ~2 + p, ora + $. We pick the numbers
Si = 1,2,3 so that they meetthe requirementof Lemma5.1.
We claim that the requirementsof Lemma 2.2 are also met
with the same81,62 and Sa + +. Assume that we pick
CJ.at random with the distribution given in Lemma

we have that P(F fl B = 0) 5 nn-l-3 = n-2. The
distributionof Cl, .... Ck with the condition F fl B = fl is the
sameas the distribution of Cl, .... Ck according to Lemma
5.1. Therefore the probability that Cl, ... . Cr: satisfiesthe
conclusion of Lemma 5.1 and so the conclusion of Theorem

Q.E.D.(Theorem2.2)
Proof of Lemma 5.1. We do not give here a detailed
proof, we only formulate the key lemmataof the proof. We
will pick the sets Cl, .... Ck sequentially and describe the
distribution of the number of intersectionsT rl C;, T E X
with one or zero elements. The following lemma describes
what happensat the choice of a single Ci (C in the lemma
below). The hypergaph(S, 2) in the lemma will play both
the role of (9, X) (for someS’ c S) and (S’, XD), where
DcSandXD =(TEXI DET).
