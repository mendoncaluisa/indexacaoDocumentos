1. Introduction
Now days, Image processing is a very dominant research area from last two decades for the researcher.
Image processing is a process by which operations are performed on the image to get intensified image
and to extract useful information from the images. Digital image processing and analog image
processing are two significant classifications of image processing. However, digital image processing
being an efficient mechanism to visualize any image, restore the distorted image, eradicate noise, and
image recognition. It is intensively employed in numerous areas such as face detection, remote
sensing, moving object sensing, etc. Although analog image processing is a continuous process
applied to analog signals and cannot be segmented into small components, it is eventually imposed as
slow and costly. It is intensively employed in numerous areas such as remote sensing, Intelligent
Vehicle and Highway System (abbreviated as IVHS) [1], etc.
Typically, the pixel is a fundamental component of an image. In other words, an image is a
combination of rows and columns (matrix) of pixels stored in electronic form and can be modified,
copied, or transferred by the computer. Significantly, an image is a two-dimensional visual

representation that contains color information. The various types of operations are employed on the
image in image processing, whereas some of them are discussed in this section.
Image segmentation is an integral aspect of image processing that fundamentally segregates the
image into distinct segments to extract valuable information that is more significant, subsequently;
obtained isolated pixels are called super-pixels. In other words, image segmentation is a preprocessing
strategy in order to analyze an image that segregates the foreground from a background of an image.
The numerous applications to tackle diverse real-life problems are adopted by image segmentation
such as machine vision, object detection, content-based image retrieval, etc.
Medical imaging is a technique employed to fabricate a visual portrayal of the interior body. This
technique predominantly revealing the intramural structure of the skin to diagnose various diseases.
This imaging technique is widely used to detect various diseases using image processing and is
broadly employed in ultrasound, elastography, nuclear medicine, and so forth in the medical field.
Image compression is a process in which the data is compressed to minimize the expense of storage
and transmission. Image compression is of two types, lossless and lossy compression. The image
compression prohibits the redundancy of the image which occupies less storage. Lossless image
compression (reversible image compression) does not slacken the size of an image, i.e., it can be
reverted to its veritable form and less data-holding capacity. In contrast, lossy image compression
(irreversible image compression) slackens the size of an image, i.e., it does not revert or reform toward
its original form and contains immense data holding capacity than Lossless image compression.
The way toward classifying an object is based on its visual substance that is called image
classification. Image classification can be divided into two categories, firstly supervised classification
in which the training region is elected and subsequently generates signature files to classify it further.
In contrast, in unsupervised classification, the image clusters are formed and further the classes are
characterized for the image classification. The various applications of image classification are object
recognition, image labeling, robotic vision, etc.
Over the most recent two decades, the metaheuristic algorithm frameworks are becoming more
popular considering how to tackle broad range type problems, issues regarding design patterns, behave
like a black-box function, the problem-independent high-level algorithmic paradigm, etc. In contrast,
the heuristic algorithms are usually problem-dependent, such as choosing the random pivot element
from a list of elements through quick sort. In the context of one word, Metaheuristic generally known
as heuristics about heuristics i.e. it provides a set of guidelines or strategy to develop such
optimization algorithms those are considered to be heuristic. The heuristic algorithms, moreover,
formulating "good guess" function to provide 'good enough' solution in order to regarding problem.
The Classification of Heuristic and Metaheuristic Optimization Algorithms are shown in figure 1.
Although, the metaheuristic algorithms have been discussed in this research manuscript hence the key
focus on it.

Figure 1. Classification of Heuristic and Metaheuristic Optimization Algorithms
During the next section, a remarkable discussion about numerous fairly well-known meta-heuristic
optimization algorithms assists in optimizing various real-world applications and several fields of
study. Surprisingly, No free lunch theorem [2] state that a unique optimization algorithm cannot tackle
all types of problems; however, all kinds of optimization algorithms cannot solve a single problem. As
such it encourages constituting novel meta-heuristic optimization algorithms and renovating existing
algorithms. The essential focal point of this section, a concise but lofty survey, is addressed about
various striking meta-heuristic optimization algorithms that assist the various image processing
domains to consider image segmentation, medical imaging, image compression, and image
classification. Let’s discuss the following section to get various application domains employed by
various meta-heuristics algorithms and their improved variants. The many abbreviated forms are

as follows: the literature review has been discussed in section 2, whereas section 3 concerns results
and discussion of this research article. Conclusively, the conclusion has been discussed in section 4 of
this manuscript.
2. Literature Review
In this section, a comprehensive discussion regarding various metaheuristic optimization techniques
and various applications of digital image processing. In addition, the advantages, disadvantages,
limitations, and future scope have been discussed for respective strategies.
2.1 Genetic Algorithm
During 1960, a marvelous as well as prestigious optimization algorithm innovated by John Holland
namely Genetic Algorithm (GA) [3, 4] in order to practically implements the principle of “Darwin’s
theory of evolution”. This principle getting the direction toward survival of fitness i.e. dissolves such
species from that environment whose cannot fit or survive in corresponding environment. The
algorithm begins with a random population and incorporates three biological evolution operators:
selection, crossover, and mutation have been executed respectively and recursively until getting the
desired outcome or course of terminated conditions. To impose the optimization algorithm's desired
properties, i.e., exploration and exploitation, are mathematically obtained by crossover and mutation
operators. Manifold research problems are optimized by means of GA; image segmentation and image
classification are the most popular out of them whose described in the coming section of this article.
2.1.1. Application of Genetic Algorithm
Hung and Wu [5] inaugurated a novel clustering method known as FCM (fuzzy c-means) using
genetic algorithm to overcome the disadvantages of FCM in form of cluster detection. The utilization
of genetic algorithm improves the quality of recognizing the cluster center, identifying several
diseases, and visualizing the anatomical structure. GFCM2G algorithm has been proposed in order to
implement GAFCM (the fundamental thought behind this algorithm is to split the genetic population
into multiple sub-populations) on the numerous embedded graphics processing units based gadgets. To
implement algorithmically and computability, proposed algorithm executing two programming models
parallel; the first one is Message-Passing Interface: MPI which is a broadcast mechanism that carries
out the execution of the algorithm, and the other one is Compute Unified Device Architecture: CUDA
that is used to enhance the computational features of the MRI segmentation.
2.2 Genetic Programming
During 1992, Genetic Programming (GP) [6-7] was inaugurated by JoneKoza. Reproduction,
crossover, and mutation operators are implemented in the initial phase, architecture-altering operation
applied during final phase in order of implementation of GP. This algorithm is a domain independent
method and based on theory of evolution which comes under Evolutionary Algorithm. Many
applications are very popular on which GP work well and provide satisfactory results as compare to
other metaheuristic optimization algorithms. Image segmentation and image classification are more
trending application areas for research work which is done by GP studying during this article.

2.2.1. Applications of Genetic Programming
Liang et al. [8] proposed three feature selection process for the image segmentation using genetic
programming, first one abbreviated as PGP-FS (Parsimony Genetic Programming Feature Selection)
that is implemented for single-objective applications, NSGP-FS (Non-dominated Sorting GPFS) and
SPGP-FS (Strength Pareto GPFS) are second and third respectively which are multi-objective,
however GP has not been looked into fairly in the field of feature selection. Single-objective as well as
multi-objective are deployed together for the feature selection and compare the method capacity for
searching effective feature subset which is to be tested on two benchmark datasets, the Weizmann and
Pascal datasets which have high variation. The proposed method is able to produce lower feature set
than the original set which contain 53 features. The goal of multi-objective in the consideration of
reducing the number of features selected and grow up the performance of segmentation, on the other
hand, the single-objective contains the ability to furnish potent feature subset on which bases the
performance has to varying. However, the multi-objective employed more powerfully in order to
generate the subset of effective feature. The diversity of the non-dominated solution is better
maintained by the NSGP-FS.
Liang et al. [9] proposed a new approach for the problem of image segmentation employed using
genetic programming. This algorithm does not require specifying the solution structure, it evolves the
segmentors that conduct the figure ground segmentation instinctual and explicitly. The segmentation
problem can be resolved more logically using top down approach and acquire the learning from object
information. The testing of this approach is done on four different datasets (bitmap, Brodatz texture,
Weizmannand, and Pascal databases) to validate the model and mature the segmentors. After the
different testing and comparison, it has been found that the proposed model is more efficient for the
purpose of image segmentation.
 In order to deal with complex image classification problems, Iqbal et al. [10] proposed a novel
method. The proposed methodology is centered on genetic programming and exchange of learning.
The proposed technique explores genetic programming's ability to seek and extract valuable
information from a straightforward errand to help become acquainted with an unpredictable
assignment alongside the utilization of transfer learning. Kylberg, Brodatz, and Outex standard data
sets are being used here, whereas they have been used unrotated earlier and rotated later to perform the
implementation. This technique involves extracting blocks of knowledge from simple images (without
considering noise and rotation) in code fragments. The previous step's extracted knowledge is used to
learn more intricate undertakings (various rotated and noisy renditions of the original images). The
extracted knowledge is reused for learning concerning multiple domains and complex images as well.
The aforesaid exchange learning technique considers GP has enhanced the classification performance
over the traditional strategies such as completed local binary count (abbreviated as CLBC), dominant
rotated LBPs (DRLBPs), and DeCAFs.
2.3. Differential Evolution
Storn and Price [11-14] proposed another evolutionary algorithm named Differential Evolution (DE)
during 1990. The DE is a population-based algorithm and no need to evaluate differentiation or
gradient to compute the candidate solution. The DE is also known as a metaheuristic optimization
algorithm covering a large search space to evaluate more optimal solutions regarding candidate
problems. While DE is not suitable for continuous problems, but it is provided a greater chance of
obtaining optimal solutions despite incomplete information or no assumptions about the candidate
problem.
2.3.1. Application of Differential Evolution
Sarkar et al. [15] proposed an unsupervised technique dependent on entropy and multi-level
thresholding to image segmentation. In this regard, the entropies are named Renyi’s entropy as well as
Cross entropy which are adopted for maximization and minimization problems respectively in order to
optimal thresholding. Decomposition-based Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithms with DE

(shortened as MOEA/D-DE) are bestowed to assess Pareto optimal solution's set. Moreover, to bring
out the approximated Pareto fronts, the MOEA/D algorithm alongside differential evolution operator
is utilized. To automatically bring out the solutions which are most appropriate for the Pareto optimal
set, the method is claimed that depends on the fuzzy membership function. Surprisingly, the
remarkable performance of proposed algorithms had been compared with other highly developed
MOEAs such as NSGA-II and MOPSO, conclude that MOEA/D-DE were dominated over them. A
comprehensive evaluation alongside neoteric single-objective global optimizer methods is likewise
carried out. Moreover, the proposed technique has been used to detect brain tumors and it worked
proficiently.
2.4. Ant Colony Optimization
In his research work of Doctor of Philosophy, Marco Dorigo submits a marvelous proposal regarding
the behavior of ants that found the food source and choose the optimal path toward their nest. The ants
follow the behavior of swarm intelligence and such algorithms are known as swarm-based algorithms.
To communicate with each other, ants disperse a special type of chemical which is known as a
pheromone. In 1992, Ant Colony Optimization abbreviated as ACO [16-18] came into the picture that
follows the intelligence behavior of ants which is discussed in his thesis article of doctor of
philosophy. ACO is the very famous metaheuristic algorithm. ACO is applying in the enormous
application of various domains. During this research article, the impressive performance of ACO
arises in the application of image classification.
2.4.1. Application of Ant Colony Optimization
JayaBrindha and GopiSubbu [19] proposed a machine vision for varietal identification on the images.
For the process of identifying other distinguishable variety in the seed testing laboratory, a machine
vision technique is used instead of manual operation. The proposed approach conducted experiments
on sunflower seeds for varietal identification. The data used here contains the sunflower seeds of ten
varieties. The techniques used here for varietal identification are Kernel LDA (Linear Discriminant
Analysis) based boundary features and Principle Component Analysis (PCA). LDA and PCA are
dimensionality reduction techniques. In this proposed approach, ant colony optimization technique is
used for obtaining the order of cascaded SVM by maximizing the total probability of correct decision.
The above system contains the ability to distinguish other seed varieties.
2.5. Bat algorithm
Bat algorithm [20] is one more latest and trending metaheuristic optimization algorithm. It was
developed by Xin-She Yang during 2010. Bat algorithm is a swarm based algorithm which applied
social intelligence to compute global optimal solution from many feasible solutions. The echolocation
behavior of microbats was the inspiration to propose this algorithm in which attempt the
communication between bats based on echoes. Easy to design, simplicity and flexibility are the
strength of this algorithm and it can be solved complex types of optimization problems. Performance
of this algorithm is discussed in next section of this research article, in which image compression
considered as the real-world application.
2.5.1. Applications of Bat algorithm
Karri and Jena [21] are enforcing Bat algorithm for image compression using fast vector quantification
in present fabrication. The bat algorithm offers a comprehensive codebook alongside the minimum
number of iterations including two parameters: loudness and pulse rate which are presumed as tuning
parameters. Existing approaches for image compression are used, yet they have some deficiencies
such as Linde–Buzo–Gray (LBG) originates lower peak signal-to-noise ratio value. PSO and Quantum
PSO [22] goes beneath instability in convergence, Honey-Bees Mating Optimization (HBM) algorithm
generates a near-optimum codebook in a limited time, firefly algorithm is shakiness when brighter
fireflies do not exist, and the convergence is the volumetric challenge in continuation of particle

swarm optimization, whenever, the velocity of the particle becomes high. The proposed mechanism
schemed uses BA on the underlying Solution of LBG. The PSNR value and quality of the
reconstructed (compressed) image are preferable over LBG, PSO-LBG, QPSO-LBG, HBMO-LBG,
and FA-LBG. Additionally, BA-LBG produces remarkable outcomes as compare to HBMO-LBG and
FA-LBG.
To Understand the unwavering quality of multispectral satellite images for examining the temporal
variations, Senthilnath et al. [23] proposed a novel approach to deal with the classification process for
assorted crop types using bat algorithm (BA-based clustering). The proposed partitional clustering
algorithm is utilized to infuse information from training samples in the form of optimal cluster centers.
Test samples are used to validate selected cluster centers. A real-time multispectral satellite image and
one benchmark data set from the UCI repository have been obliged algorithm's reliability. The fruition
of this approach is coordinated with several techniques such as BKM, GA, and PSO. Classification
efficiency and time complexity are considered as evaluating parameters to figure out the outcomes.
Compared to other metaheuristic techniques such as GA and PSO, BA is more computationally
efficient. It is concluded that BA precisely converges optimal cluster centers and can be applied for
tackling crop type classification problems.
2.6. Particle Swarm Optimization
During 1995, a prestigious research came into the picture to simulate social behavior firstly by
Kennedy and Eberhart in the proposal of Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) [24]. PSO is a swarm
based optimization algorithm and simulate social intelligence to compute optimal solution for complex
optimization problems. There are two evaluating parameters to implement this algorithm, one is
PBEST which is the personal best and other is GBEST which contain the global best or group best.
PBEST is individual best and best out of PBEST considered as GBEST. The velocity and position
vector (calculated by equation (1)) are mathematical model computing parameters on which PBEST
got evaluate. A lot of real life optimization problems and applications are describing in literature,
although, the performance of this algorithm is discussed in next section of this research article, out of
those applications image segmentation as well as medical image is the discussing application.
The ‘w’ maintains the harmony between exploitation and exploration to ably performance of
the algorithm. Although, it implies a constant value and is known as inertia weight. In comparison,
‘ ’ and ‘ ’ are also constant variables and well perform a balance among exploitation and
exploration parameters. Hence, (t+1) is the updated position for the next iteration. The above
process is iteratively repeated till maximum number of iterations.
2.6.1. Applications of Particle Swarm Optimization
Mozafarri and Lee [25] proposed an algorithm for the image segmentation using image thresholding
and for better optimization particle swarm optimization is used. The basic idea is to divide the
particles into four sub-swarms for searching problem space. The method uses a new modified version
of PSO which is Convergent Heterogeneous PSO algorithm; it gives better convergence, better

jumping to local position to global position. The Otsu’s and Kapur’s multilevel thresholding method
have been used and the benchmark images is considered as dataset for the evaluation. All the
experimental results show that CHPSO gives significantly remarkable accuracy and outstanding
performances.
Zhang et al. [26] introduced the approach regarding real time segmentation that distinguish
target image from the navigation image. To implement this approach, the Quantum Particle Swarm
Optimization abbreviated as QPSO along with 2D fuzzy fisher are used to accomplish more accurate
and quick segmentation in form of results corresponding to the input image. The 2D fuzzy fisher
employed to make the adaptability between positioning target regions and retaining the boundaries of
target fuzzy, based on criterion based integral image and the QPSO is used to encode current location
of particles and mutative manipulation adds diversity to the particle swarm. The enhancements in its
local searching capacity during the course of each iteration and to get the fast convergence, results is
obtain by adding random orthogonal component along with quasi –optimum particle. The model is
validated to check its competency of getting hasty segmentation and less valid signals simultaneously.
To determine the bone age maturity, Sabeti et al. [27] in this proposed work adopted three
various versions of PSO. Various image processing methods are also owned. The dataset considered
here contains left hand-wrist radiographs source of sixty-five referred children. The reason behind
adopting three PSO versions is to magnify the segmentation accuracy. “The three versions of particle
swarm optimization are standard PSO, Worst Behavior-based version of PSO abbreviated as WB-PSO
and Adaptive Inertia Weight version of PSO abbreviated as AIW-PSO along with Otsu algorithm and
an reiteratively statistical method are operated for segmentation of hand radiographs” [27]. The
outcomes of Otsu algorithm along with above various versions of particle swarm optimization as well
as iteratively statistical methods yielded 81.76, 82.49, 83.08, 84.27, and 69.04 percent classification
accuracy respectively. White Gaussian noise along with various intensities was assembled to the
compiled images to check vigorousness of schemed techniques. The fruition indicated that while
increases the noise level the robustness against this white gaussian noise for the PSO variants also
raised in more advertised manner as compared to Otsu as well as statistical methods. AIW-PSO image
segmentation works efficiently for bone age estimation.
The other swarm-based algorithms such as ABC can be applied in other application areas such
as wireless sensor network. Whereas, Karaboga [28] proposed a swarm-based metaheuristic
optimization algorithm named artificial bee colony in 2005. The artificial bee colony is abbreviated as
ABC and it has been inspired by the foraging behavior of honey bee swarm. The three group
formation has been classified based on the intelligent foraging behavior of honey bees in order to the
mathematical model. The author has proposed an approach namely SBHRA [29] to improving the
stability, throughput, and lifetime of sensor node based on cluster network through ABC.
2.7. Cuckoo Search
In 2009, Yang and Deb [30] proposed a novel meta-heuristic optimization algorithm called Cuckoo
Search (CS). The CS algorithm is an evolutionary population-based algorithm propelled by the
lifestyle of the cuckoo bird family. The fascinating singing style and attractive voice are implied to be
controlling paradigms that emphasize movement gradually to obtain the best solution from the
previous solution. The cuckoo throws alien eggs from the current nest of host birds or searches the
new nest to keep their egg that is considered the rule of thumb of this bird. The selection or locating
the best nest to the cuckoo is considered as the main objective in the biological analogy. Similarly,
explore the optimal solution concerning the real-world problem is the primary objective of the cuckoo
search algorithm.
2.7.1. Application of Cuckoo Search
Bhandari et al. [31] proposed an advanced approach for image segmentation concerning color images
using the Cuckoo Search algorithm utilized by Tsallis entropy for multilevel thresholding arranged by
red, green, and NIR band. The fundamental objective of the applied algorithm is to pick the optimal

9
threshold value for the segmentation process. The algorithm is benchmarked upon ten different
colored images that were captured by satellite. Additionally, SSIM, FSIM, PSNR, and MSE are
considered as performance evaluation matrices. Furthermore, the performance has compared to DE,
WDO, PSO, and ABC meta-heuristics algorithms and it has been found that implemented algorithm
outperforms them. The accuracy of this algorithm is defined as far as the threshold's best objective
value and computational cost in terms of CPU time. The limitation of this algorithm is in regard to
color image multilevel thresholding, and the algorithm is found to be intricate. In contrast, this
algorithm's profitability has meager control parameters, unlike DE, WDO, PSO, and ABC algorithms.
This work's future scope can be utilized in real-time sophisticated image processing in which image
classification, satellite image enhancement; various computer vision problems, etc. can be considered.
2.8. Firefly algorithm
Yang [32] introduced a meta-heuristic optimization algorithm that was inspired by flashing pattern of
fireflies and mimic the characteristics of them, named Firefly algorithm (FA). The objective function
is formed from brightness of firefly and the main objective has to consider the improvement in
brightness of the fireflies. The light intensity is inversely square proportional to the distance.
Consequentially, low light intensity implies large distance and vice versa. Hence, every firefly is
considered as solution and the objective is to minimize the distance between them. To achieve the
above objective, the equation (3) is applied to movement of ith firefly (position ) toward jth firefly
(position ) (jth firefly is more attractive than ith firefly):
Whereas, α is randomization parameter {α∈[0, 1]} and rand contains a random value [0, 1].
Although, the equation of β is derived from light intensity formula and calculated as:
β0 is known as attractiveness coefficient [β0= 1]. Whereas, rij is the Cartesian distance between
position of ith firefly and jth firefly and calculated as:
The above equations are repeated till maximum iteration and produced an optimal solution for
the optimization problem.
2.8.1. Application of Firefly algorithm
In image segmentation, conventional methods interpolate exceptionally high computational costs and
breakdowns of their efficiency to accomplish the optimal threshold. This limitation motivates the
application of meta-heuristics algorithms such as evolutionary algorithms or swarm intelligence
algorithms. Naidu et al. [33] have proposed a multilevel thresholding algorithm utilized by the firefly
algorithm to accomplish the above limitation. The objective is to maximize the Fuzzy entropy and
Shannon entropy for the image segmentation. The algorithm is tested upon a natural and standard set
of images (Lena, Goldhill, Pirate, and Starfish) to validate the performance and is additionally
compared with other optimization techniques such as DE, BA, and PSO. PSNR, CPU Time, SSIM,
Misclassification Error, Computational Complexity, and Stability Analysis are considered evaluation

metrics. The outcomes of the simulation clarify that the firefly algorithm outperforms the DE, BA, and
PSO with respect to all evaluation matrices. In consideration of future work, the efficiency and
convergence time will be enhanced by distinct optimization algorithms or an improved firefly
algorithm.
2.9. Grey wolf optimizer
Grey wolf optimizer is a neoteric meta-heuristic optimization algorithm that is designed, formulated
mathematically, and coded by Mirjalili et al. [34] during 2014. The grey wolf is non-domestic and
found in North America as well as Eurasia and it is famous with a scientific name canis lupus
subspecies. The hunting behaviour of grey wolves was the inspiration toward this meta-heuristics
optimization algorithm. The grey wolves follow special type of strategy to attempt hunting their target
in which a leadership hierarchy getting implements between pack of wolves. This leadership hierarchy
(Figure (2)) contains top level i.e. leader of the pack known as alpha, wolf at the next level known to
be beta, wolf at the next subsequent level known as delta, and omega types of wolves considered at the
bottom level, out of which top three hierarchy are considered as best three solutions and calculated by
equation (4) during this algorithm. GWO performs remarkable in many research applications and
provide good results while solving complex types of problems. The performance of this algorithm is
discussed in the next section of this research article in which image segmentation and medical image
are considering as research domain.
Figure 2. Leadership Social Hierarchy of Grey Wolf
During the hunting process, the alpha, beta, and delta indicate the best position of prey and
accordingly update the position of the remaining wolves (omega) of the pack. The hunting process is
imposed as follows:
Where X1, X2, and X3 are the positions of the prey according to alpha, beta, and delta grey wolf,
respectively that is calculated as:
, , and are distance between prey and alpha, beta, and delta grey wolf, respectively
that is calculated as:

2.9.1. Applications of Grey wolf optimizer
With rise in the number of thresholds computational, complications also increase in multilevel
thresholding. Understanding this hitch, Khairuzzaman and Chaudhury [35] adopted Grey wolf
optimizer algorithm for multilevel thresholding in this proposed work. Here, in the consideration of
GWO, Kapur’s entropy as well as Otsu’s between class variance functions are also owned. The
validation of this proposed work is done on various standard test images sets which are showing in the
summarizing table. To figure out the traits of segmented images, mean structural similarity is
abbreviated as MSSIM exploited as an index. The outcome of testing phase shows that the above
scheme provides high quality solutions as compared to particle swarm optimization as well as bacterial
foraging optimization. When compared to bacterial foraging optimization, grey wolf optimizer is
faster but slower than particle swarm optimization.
Li et al. [36] suggested and proposed a technique to extricate multi-level thresholding in the
domain of image segmentation. In order to retrieve a bunch of thresholds, Modified Discrete GWO,
abbreviated as MDGWO, is possessed to improve (optimize) the objective function adopted by Fuzzy
Kapur’s entropy. MDGWO, however, is utilized as the apparatus, which infers pseudo-trapezoidal
shape to form a fuzzy membership. Further, by owning local information aggregation image
segmentation is done. When this applied with fuzzy it becomes FMDGWO. Improved PSNR and
objective function values are ensured by FMDGWO while Electro-magnetism Optimization
abbreviated as EMO, MDGWO, and Fuzzy entropy based Differential Evolution algorithm that is
abbreviated as FDE are not as efficient as FMDGWO. FMDGWO performs high-level segmentation
and has to ensure more stability.
Although, determining discrete wavelet transform based methods [37] yield a prominent
degree of approximation yet the availability of edge features is less in medical image fusion for
clinical disease identification. Daniel et al. [38] proposed a scheme of cascaded laplacian wavelet
mask abbreviated as CLWM is reliant on fusion utilization of Hybrid variant in which Cuckoo search
combined with Grey wolf optimizer, named as HCS-GWO to the fusion of the multimodal medical
image in this proposed work. During the initial phase, several fusion evaluation indexes are
considered, the introduced strategy is checked to Magnetic Resonance- Single Photon Emission
Tomography (shortened as MR-SPECT), MR-Positron Emission Tomography, MR Computerized
Tomography (shortened as MR-CT), and MR T1-T2 image fusion. GWA is combined with the CSA in
the implementation of the final phase. CLWM is compared with other highly developed fusion
techniques for validation and robustness that considers Entropy, MI, QAB/F, and standard deviation
values as the appraisal of parameters. The developed framework is remarkably more effective than
other highly developed enhancements techniques. The complementary feature fusions are acquired
through using this proposed methodology, which offers the significance for medical diagnosis.
Finishing up the multi-modal image fusion scaling techniques taking into account static value
selection reduces the quality of the fusion. To conquer the above limitation, Daniel et al. [39]
developed an Optimal Spectrum Mask Fusion that is abbreviated as an OSMF for medical image
fusion through a standard GWO algorithm to enhance clinical diagnosis. The GWO algorithm
performs the fastest and selects dynamic scale; whereas the spectrum mask based fusion technique is
adopted to enhance image contrast and edge quality. Plenty of information is gathered by the optimum
mask in the multi-modality fusion. Brain’s images MR: T1-T2, MR-SPECT, MR-PET, and MR-CT

are being used for the validation of the proposed OSFM. This approach dominates other customary
techniques involving fusion based on pixels and yields enhanced outcomes.
Ramakrishnan and Sankaragomathi [40] proposed a research work in order to classification
and segmentation of Computed Tomography images (CT images) to assess the existence of tumor.
The support vector machine classifier assists in the classification process to classify the images that
involve tumor-containing and tumor-free images alongside certain kernel functions (such as Quadratic
kernel function, Radial basis function, Linear kernel, Polynomial kernel, and MLP function) and
various optimization techniques (such as Sequential Minimal Optimization, Least-Squares, and
Quadratic Programming abbreviated as SMO, LS, and QP respectively). After the implementation of
classification operation, segmentation is performed using Modified Region Growing (MRG) along
with certain optimization algorithms (such as HS, GWO, and EP) are employed. The CT images data
set is fetched from specialists (M/s Aarthi scans, Tirunelveli, India). The outcomes are validated using
various parameters such as sensitivity, explicitness, and precision. The proposed tumor detection
approach (MRG-GWO) is more precise than the other two techniques (HS and EP).
3. Results and Discussion
The problem-independent definition sparkle a significant milestone to meta-heuristic techniques.
These techniques are becoming increasingly plausible day to day because of their versatility,
simplicity, and flexibility. The meta-heuristic techniques are greatly ingenious to understand, readily
adjustable, and utilized in various fields of analysis, real-world applications, and research areas.
Conversely, low convergence rate and stuck in local optima are such limitations that constitute it more
challenging. Introduce, produce, and innovate in order to novel meta-heuristics algorithms and their
variants are utilized to overcome the aforementioned limitations and to conform with the no free lunch
theorem [2].

4. Conclusion
Image processing is a vast area for researchers at the current time, gives rise to several new algorithms
to implement and use image processing in efficient ways. The different application domains of image
processing like image segmentation can be implemented more efficiently with GA, GP, FA, GWO,
and PSO optimization algorithms which help obtain the results quickly and in a wide range.
An optimization algorithm like BAT algorithm, when applied to the image compression it assists in
increasing the compression ratio leaving no effect on the image quality. The algorithms like GP, BAT,

and ACO when applied to employ image classification then the techniques can easily trigger the
complexity of the image variation providing fruitful results. The medical field also has various image
processing applications like anatomical study, detection of tumors, and other disease prediction and
treatment. The metaheuristic optimization algorithms such as PSO, GWO, and DE are used for more
efficacious results to implement medical imaging more efficiently. These algorithms help obtain more
specific information from the image, which is used to predict more precisely.
Finally, in this manuscript, it has been discussed that optimization algorithms used in image
processing and its applications eventually provide remarkable outcomes and these are less dependent
on the input image acquired. It has been also found that GA, ACO, GWO, GP, etc., algorithms have
provided superior results even in cluttered and high variation images compared to standard algorithms.
