An encryption method is presented with the novel
property that publicly revealing an encryption key
does not thereby reveal the corresponding decryption
key. This has two important consequences:
(1) Couriers or other secure means are not needed to
transmit keys, since a message can be enciphered
using an encryption key publicly revealed by the
intended recipient. Only he can decipher the message,
since only he knows the corresponding decryption key.
(2) A message can be "signed" using a privately held
decryption key. Anyone can verify this signature using
the corresponding publicly revealed encryption key.
Signatures cannot be forged, and a signer cannot later
deny the validity of his signature. This has obvious
applications in "electronic mail" and "electronic funds
transfer" systems. A message is encrypted by
representing it as a number M, raising M to a publicly
specified power e, and then taking the remainder
when the result is divided by the publicly specified
product, n, of two large secret prime numbers p and q.
Decryption is similar; only a different, secret, power d
is used, where e * d ------l ( m o d (p - 1) * (q - 1)). The
security of the system rests in part on the difficulty of
factoring the published divisor, n.

I. Introduction
The era of "electronic mail" [10] may soon be upon
us; we must ensure that two important properties of
the current "paper mail" system are preserved: (a)
messages are private, and (b) messages can be signed.
We demonstrate in this paper how to build these
capabilities into an electronic mail system.
At the heart of our proposal is a new encryption
method. This method provides an implementation of a
"public-key cryptosystem", an elegant concept in-
vented by Diffie and Hellman [1]. Their article moti-
vated our research, since they presented the concept
but not any practical implementation of such a system.
Readers familiar with [1] may wish to skip directly to
Section V for a description of our method.
II. Public-Key Cryptosystems
In a "public-key cryptosystem" each user places in
a public file an encryption procedure E. That is, the
public file is a directory giving the encryption proce-
dure of each user. The user keeps secret the details of
his corresponding decryption procedure D. These pro-
cedures have the following four properties:
(a) Deciphering the enciphered form of a message M
yields M. Formally,
D(E(M)) = M. (I)
(b) Both E and D are easy to compute.
(c) By publicly revealing E the user does not reveal an
easy way to compute D. This means that in practice
only he can decrypt messages encrypted with E, or
compute D efficiently.
(d) If a message M is first deciphered and then enci-
phered, M is the result. Formally,
E(D(M)) = M. (2)
An encryption (or decryption) procedure typically
consists of a general method and an encryption key. The
general method, under control of the key, enciphers a
message M to obtain the enciphered form of the
message, called the ciphertext C. Everyone can use the
same general method; the security of a given procedure
will rest on the security of the key. Revealing an
encryption algorithm then means revealing the key.
When the user reveals E he reveals a very inefficient
method of computing D(C): testing all possible mes-
sages M until one such that E(M) = C is found. If
property (c) is satisfied the number of such messages to
test will be so large that this approach is impractical.
A function E satisfying (a)-(c) is a "trap-door one-
way function;" if it also satisfies (d) it is a "trap-door
one-way permutation." Diffie and Hellman [1] intro-
duced the concept of trap-door one-way functions but
C o m m u n i c a t i o n s February 1978
of V o l u m e 21
the A C M N u m b e r 2
did not present any examples. These functions are
called "one-way" because they are easy to compute in
one direction but (apparently) very difficult to compute
in the other direction. They are called "trap-door"
functions since the inverse functions are in fact easy to
compute once certain private "trap-door" information
is known. A trap-door one-way function which also
satisfies (d) must be a permutation: every message is
the ciphertext for some other message and every ci-
phertext is itself a permissible message. (The mapping
is "one-to-one" and "onto"). Property (d) is needed
only to implement "signatures".
The reader is encouraged to read Diffie and Hell-
man's excellent article [1] for further background, for
elaboration of the concept of a public-key cryptosys-
tem, and for a discussion of other problems in the area
of cryptography. The ways in which a public-key cryp-
tosystem can ensure privacy and enable "signatures"
(described in Sections III and IV below) are also due
to Diffie and Hellman.
For our scenarios we suppose that A and B (also
known as Alice and Bob) are two users of a public-key
cryptosystem. We will distinguish their encryption and
decryption procedures with subscripts: EA, DA, F_~, DB.
III. Privacy
Encryption is the standard means of rendering a
communication private. The sender enciphers each
message before transmitting it to the receiver. The
receiver (but no unauthorized person) knows the ap-
propriate deciphering function to apply to the received
message to obtain the original message. An eavesdrop-
per who hears the transmitted message hears only
"garbage" (the ciphertext) which makes no sense to
him since he does not know how to decrypt it.
The large volume of personal and sensitive infor-
mation currently held in computerized data banks and
transmitted over telephone lines makes encryption
increasingly important. In recognition of the fact that
efficient, high-quality encryption techniques are very
much needed but are in short supply, the National
Bureau of Standards has recently adopted a "Data
Encryption Standard" [13, 14], developed at IBM.
The new standard does not have property (c), needed
to implement a public-key cryptosystem.
All classical encryption methods (including the NBS
standard) suffer from the "key distribution problem."
The problem is that before a private communication
can begin, another private transaction is necessary to
distribute corresponding encryption and decryption
keys to the sender and receiver, respectively. Typically
a private courier is used to carry a key from the sender
to the receiver. Such a practice is not feasible if an
electronic mail system is to be rapid and inexpensive.
A public-key cryptosystem needs no private couriers;
the keys can be distributed over the insecure commu-
nications channel.
How can Bob send a private message M to Alice in
121
a public-key cryptosystem? First, he retrieves lEA from
the public file. Then he sends her the enciphered
message EA(M). Alice deciphers the message by com-
puting DA(EA (M)) = M. By property (c) of the public-
key cryptosystem only she can decipher EA(M). She
can encipher a private response with Ea, also available
in the public file.
Observe that no private transactions between Alice
and Bob are needed to establish private communica-
tion. The only "setup" required is that each user who
wishes to receive private communications must place
his enciphering algorithm in the public file.
Two users can also establish private communication
over an insecure communications channel without con-
suiting a public file. Each user sends his encryption key
to the other. Afterwards all messages are enciphered
with the encryption key of the recipient, as in the
public-key system. An intruder listening in on the
channel cannot decipher any messages, since it is not
possible to derive the decryption keys from the encryp-
tion keys. (We assume that the intruder cannot modify
or insert messages into the channel.) Ralph Merkle has
developed another solution [5] to this problem.
A public-key cryptosystem can be used to "boot-
strap" into a standard encryption scheme such as the
NBS method. Once secure communications have been
established, the first message transmitted can be a key
to use in the NBS scheme to encode all following
messages. This may be desirable if encryption with our
method is slower than with the standard scheme. (The
NBS scheme is probably somewhat faster if special-
purpose hardware encryption devices are used; our
scheme may be faster on a general-purpose computer
since multiprecision arithmetic operations are simpler
to implement than complicated bit manipulations.)
IV. Signatures
If electronic mail systems are to replace the existing
paper mail system for business transactions, "signing"
an electronic message must be possible. The recipient
of a signed message has proof that the message origi-
nated from the sender. This quality is stronger than
mere authentication (where the recipient can verify
that the message came from the sender); the recipient
can convince a "judge" that the signer sent the mes-
sage. To do so, he must convince the judge that he did
not forge the signed message himself! In an authenti-
cation problem the recipient does not worry about this
possibility, since he only wants to satisfy himself that
the message came from the sender.
An electronic signature must be message-depend-
ent, as well as signer-dependent. Otherwise the recipi-
ent could modify the message before showing the
message-signature pair to a judge. Or he could attach
the signature to any message whatsoever, since it is
impossible to detect electronic "cutting and pasting."
To implement signatures the public-key cryptosys-
Communications February 1978
of Volume 21
the ACM Number 2
tem must be implemented with trap-door one-way
permutations (i.e. have property (d)), since the decryp-
tion algorithm will be applied to unenciphered mes-
sages.
How can user Bob send Alice a "signed" message
M in a public-key cryptosystem? He first computes his
"signature" S for the message M using I)a:
S = D~(M).
(Deciphering an unenciphered message " m a k e s sense"
by property (d) of a public key cryptosystem: each
message is the ciphertext for some other message.) He
then encrypts S using EA (for privacy), and sends the
result EA(S) to Alice. H e need not send M as well; it
can be computed from S.
Alice first decrypts the ciphertext with DA to obtain
S. She knows who is the presumed sender of the
signature (in this case, Bob); this can be given if
necessary in plain text attached to S. She then extracts
the message with the encryption procedure of the
sender, in this case F-u (available on the public file):
M = F~(S).
She now possesses a message-signature pair (M, S)
with properties similar to those of a signed paper
document.
Bob cannot later deny having sent Alice this mes-
sage, since no one else could have created S = DB (M).
Alice can convince a " j u d g e " that Eu(S) = M, so she
has proof that Bob signed the document.
Clearly Alice cannot modify M to a different ver-
sion M ' , since then she would have to create the
corresponding signature S' = I ~ ( M ' ) as well.
T h e r e f o r e Alice has received a message "signed"
by Bob, which she can " p r o v e " that he sent, but which
she cannot modify. (Nor can she forge his signature for
any other message.)
An electronic checking system could be based on a
signature system such as the above. It is easy to imagine
an encryption device in your home terminal allowing
you to sign checks that get sent by electronic mail to
the payee. It would only be necessary to include a
unique check n u m b e r in each check so that even if the
payee copies the check the bank will only h o n o r the
first version it sees.
A n o t h e r possibilityarises if encryption devices can
be made fast enough: it will be possible to have a
telephone conversation in which every word spoken is
signed by the encryption device before transmission.
When encryption is used for signatures as above, it
is important that the encryption device not be "wired
in" between the terminal (or computer) and the com-
munications channel, since a message may have to be
successively enciphered with several keys. It is perhaps
more natural to view the encryption device as a "hard-
ware subroutine" that can he executed as needed.
We have assumed above that each user can always
access the public file reliably. In a " c o m p u t e r n e t w o r k "
this might be difficult; an " i n t r u d e r " might forge
1 2 2
messages purporting to be from the public file. The
user would like to be sure that he actually obtains the
encryption procedure o f his desired correspondent and
not, say, the encryption procedure of the intruder. This
danger disappears if t h e public file "signs" each mes-
sage it sends to a user. The user can check the signature
with the public file's encryption algorithm F_~v. The
problem of "looking u p " F-er itself in the public file is
avoided by giving each user a description of F_~r when
he first shows up (in person) to join the public-key
cryptosystem and to deposit his public encryption pro-
cedure. He then stores this description rather than ever
looking it up again. The need for a courier between
every pair of users has thus been replaced by the
requirement for a single secure meeting between each
user and the public-file manager when the user joins
the system. A n o t h e r solution is to give each user, when
he signs up, a book (like a telephone directory) con-
taining all the encryption keys of users in the system.
V. Our Encryption and Decryption Methods
To encrypt a message M with our method, using a
public encryption key (e, n), proceed as follows. (Here
e and n are a pair of positive integers.)
First, represent the message as an integer between
0 and n - 1. (Break a long message into a series of
blocks, and represent each block as such an integer.)
Use any standard representation. The purpose here is
not to encrypt the message but only to get it into the
numeric form necessary for encryption.
Then, encrypt the message by raising it to the e th
power modulo n . That is, the result (the ciphertext C)
is the remainder when Me is divided by n .
To decrypt the ciphertext, raise it to another
power d , again modulo n . The encryption and decryp-
tion algorithms E and D are thus:
C -- E ( M ) -= M e (mod n ), for a message M.
D(C) = C~ ( m o d n ) , for a ciphertext C.
Note that encryption does not increase the size of a
message; both the message and the ciphertext are
integers in the range 0 to n - 1.
The encryption key is thus the pair of positive
integers (e, n). Similarly, the decryption key is the pair
of positive integers (d, n). Each user makes his encryp-
tion key public, and keeps the corresponding decryp-
tion key private. (These integers should properly be
subscripted as in hA, eA, and dA, since each user has
his own set. H o w e v e r , we will only consider a typical
set, and will omit the subscripts.)
H o w should you choose your encryption and de-
cryption keys, if you want to use our method?
You first compute n as the product of two primesp
and q :
n = p * q .
These primes are very large, " r a n d o m " primes. AI-
C o m m u n i c a t i o n s February 1978
of V o l u m e 21
the A C M N u m b e r 2
though you will m a k e n public, the factorsp a n d q will
be effectively hidden from everyone else due to the
enormous difficulty of factoring n . This also hides the
way d can be derived from e.
You then pick the integer d to be a large, random
integer which is relatively prime to (p - 1) * (q - 1).
That is, check that d satisfies:
g c d ( d , ( p - 1 ) * ( q - 1 ) ) = 1
("gcd" means "greatest c o m m o n divisor").
The integer e is finally computed from p, q, and d
to be the "multiplicative inverse" of d , modulo (p - 1)
• (q - 1). Thus we have
e * d ~ - l ( m o d ( p - 1 ) * ( q - 1)).
We prove in the next section that this guarantees
that (1) and (2) hold, i.e. that E and D are inverse
permutations. Section VII shows how each of the
above operations can be done efficiently.
The aforementioned m e t h o d should not be con-
fused with the "exponentiation" technique presented
by Diffie and Hellman [1] to solve the key distribution
problem. Their technique permits two users to deter-
mine a key in common to be used in a normal crypto-
graphic system. It is not based on a trap-door one-way
permutation. Pohlig and Hellman [8] study a scheme
related to ours, where exponentiation is done modulo
a prime number.
VI. The Underlying Mathematics
We demonstrate the correctness of the deciphering
algorithm using an identity due to Euler and Fermat
[7]: for any integer (message) M which is relatively
prime to n ,
M ¢tn) -- 1 ( m o d n ) . (3)
H e r e ~0(n) is the Euler totient function giving the
number of positive integers less than n which are
relatively prime to n . For prime numbers p ,
~(p) = p - 1.
In our case, we have by elementary properties of the
totient function [7]:
~0(n) = ~0(p) • ~p(q),
= ( p - 1 ) * ( q - 1) (4)
= n - ( p + q ) + l.
Since d is relatively prime to ~o(n), it has a multipli-
cative inverse e in the ring of integers modulo ~o(n) :
e * d - 1 (mod ~0(n)). (5)
We now prove that equations (1) and ( 2 ) hold
(that is, that deciphering works correctly ife and d are
chosen as above). Now
D(E(M))------ (E(M))a ~ (Me) a ~ M e*a (moOn)
E ( D ( M ) ) ~ (D(M)) e ~ (Ma) e ~ M e*a (mod n)
and
123
1VIe*a --= M ~*~")+a (mod n) (for some integer k ).
From (3) we see that for all M such that p does not
divide M
Mp-1 --- 1 ( m o d p )
and since (t9 - 1) divides ~p(n)
IVl~*~"~+1 --- M ( m o d p ) .
This is trivially true when M -= 0(mod p ) , so that this
equality actually holds for all M. Arguing similarly for
q yields
M ~*¢(n)+l ~ M ( m o d q ) .
Together these last two equations imply that for all M,
Me~ -- M k*~n)+l ---- M (mod n).
This implies (1) and (2) for all M, 0 -- M < n .
Therefore E and D are inverse permutations. (We
thank Rich Schroeppel for suggesting the above im-
proved version of the authors' previous proof.)
VII. Algorithms
To show that our method is practical, we describe
an efficient algorithm for each required operation.
A. How to Encrypt and Decrypt Efficiently
Computing M e (mod n ) requires at most 2 * log2(e)
multiplications and 2 • log2(e) divisions using the
following procedure (decryption can be performed
similarly using d instead of e ):
Step 1. Let ehek-i • • • ele0 be the binary representa-
tion o f e .
Step 2. Set the variable C to 1.
Step 3. Repeat steps 3 a a n d 3b f o r i = k , k - 1,
. . . , O :
Step 3a. Set C to the remainder of C 2 when
divided by n .
Step 3b. Ifei = 1, then set C to the remainder
of C * M when divided by n .
Step 4. Halt. Now C is the encrypted form of M.
This procedure is called "exponentiation by re-
peated squaring and multiplication." This procedure is
half as good as the best; more efficient procedures are
known. Knuth [3] studies this problem in detail.
The fact that the enciphering and deciphering are
identical leads to a simple implementation. (The whole
operation can be implemented on a few special-purpose
integrated circuit chips.)
A high-speed computer can encrypt a 200-digit
message M in a few seconds; special-purpose hardware
would be much faster. The encryption time per block
increases no faster than the cube of the number of
digits in n .
B. How to Find Large Prime Numbers
Each user must (privately) choose two large ran-
Communications February 1978
of Volume 21
the ACM Number 2
d o m prime n u m b e r s p and q to create his own encryp-
tion and decryption keys. These numbers must be
large so that it is not computationally feasible for
anyone to factor n = p * q . ( R e m e m b e r that n , but
not p or q , will be in the public file.) We r e c o m m e n d
using 100-digit (decimal) prime numbers p and q , so
that n has 200 digits.
T o find a 100-digit " r a n d o m " prime n u m b e r , gen-
erate (odd) 100-digit r a n d o m n u m b e r s until a prime
n u m b e r is found. By the prime n u m b e r t h e o r e m [7],
about (In 101°°)/2 = 115 n u m b e r s will be tested before
a prime is found.
To test a large n u m b e r b for primality we recom-
m e n d the elegant "probabilistic" algorithm due to
Solovay and Strassen [12]. It picks a r a n d o m n u m b e r
a from a uniform distribution on {1, . . . , b - 1}, and
tests whether
gcd(a, b) = 1 and J(a, b) -= a~b-1)/2(mod b), (6)
where J(a, b) is the Jacobi symbol [7]. I f b is prime (6)
is always true. If b is composite (6) will be false with
probability at least 1/2. If (6) holds for 100 randomly
chosen values of a then b is almost certainly prime;
there is a (negligible) chance of one in 2l°° that b is
composite. E v e n if a composite were accidentally used
in our system, the receiver would probably detect this
by noticing that decryption didn't work correctly.
When b is odd, a -< b , and gcd(a, b) = 1, the Jacobi
symbol J(a, b) has a value in { - 1 , 1} and can be
efficiently c o m p u t e d by the p r o g r a m :
J(a, b) = ifa = 1 then 1 else
ifa is even then J(a/2, b) * ( - 1) tb2-1)/8
else J(b(mod a), a) * ( - 1)<a-1)~b-1)/4
(The computations of J(a, b) and gcd(a, b) can be
nicely combined, too.) N o t e that this algorithm does
not test a n u m b e r for primality by trying to factor it.
O t h e r efficient procedures for testing a large n u m b e r
for primality are given in [6, 9, 11].
T o gain additional protection against sophisticated
factoring a l g o r i t h m s , p and q should differ in length by
a few digits, both (p - 1) and (q - 1) should contain
large prime factors, and gcd(p - 1, q - 1) should be
small. The latter condition is easily checked.
To find a prime n u m b e r p such that (p - 1) has a
large prime factor, generate a large r a n d o m prime
n u m b e r u , then l e t p be the first prime in the sequence
i * u + 1, f o r i = 2, 4, 6, . . . . (This shouldn't take
too long.) Additional security is provided by ensuring
that (u - 1) also has a large prime factor.
A high-speed c o m p u t e r can determine in several
seconds whether a 100-digit n u m b e r is prime, and can
find the first prime after a given point in a minute or
two.
A n o t h e r a p p r o a c h to finding large prime n u m b e r s
is to take a n u m b e r of known factorization, add one to
it, and test the result for primality. If a prime p is
found it is possible to p r o v e that it really is prime by
using the factorization of p - 1. W e omit a discussion
of this since the probabilistic m e t h o d is adequate.
C. H o w to C h o o s e d
It is very easy to choose a n u m b e r d which is
relatively p r i m e to ~o(n). For example, any prime
n u m b e r greater than max(p, q) will do. It is i m p o r t a n t
that d should be chosen f r o m a large enough set so
that a cryptanalyst cannot find it by direct search.
D . H o w to C o m p u t e e f r o m d and ,p(n)
To c o m p u t e e , use the following variation of Eu-
clid's algorithm for computing the greatest c o m m o n
divisor of ~o(n) and d . (See exercise 4.5.2.15 in [3].)
Calculate gcd(~o(n), d) by computing a seriesx0, xl, x2,
. . . , wherex0 = 9(n), X 1 = d , andxi+l - - x i _ l ( m o d x i ) ,
until anxk equal to 0 is found. T h e n gcd(x0, xa) = xk-a.
C o m p u t e for each xi n u m b e r s ai and b, such that xi =
ai * x0 + bi * x~. If xk-1 = 1 then bk-1 is the
multiplicative inverse of xl ( m o d x0). Since k will be
less than 2 * log~(n), this c o m p u t a t i o n is very rapid.
I f e turns out to be less than log~(n), start o v e r by
choosing a n o t h e r value of d . This guarantees that
every encrypted message (except M = 0 or M = 1)
undergoes some " w r a p - a r o u n d " (reduction m o d u l o n).
V I H . A Small E x a m p l e
Consider the c a s e p = 47, q = 59, n = p * q = 47
• 59 = 2773, and d = 157. Then ~o(2773) = 46 * 58 =
2668, and e can be c o m p u t e d as follows:
x 0 = 2 6 6 8 , a 0 = 1, b 0 = 0 ,
x 1= 157, a l = 0 , b l = l ,
x 2= 156, a 2= 1 , bz = - 1 6 (since 2668
= 1 5 7 . 1 6 + 1 5 6 ) ,
x 3= 1, a a= - 1 , b3 = 17 (since 157 = 1
• 156 + 1).
T h e r e f o r e e = 17, the multiplicative inverse (mod
2668) of d = 157.
With n = 2773 we can encode two letters per
block, substituting a two-digit n u m b e r for each letter:
b l a n k = 00, A = 0 1 , B = 0 2 , . . . , Z = 26. Thus the
message
ITS ALL GREEK TO ME
(Julius Caesar, I, ii, 288, p a r a p h r a s e d ) is encoded:
0920 1900 0112 1200 0718
0505 1100 2015 0013 0500
Since e = 10001 in binary, the first block (M = 920)
is enciphered:
M 17 - (((((1) z * M)2)2)2) 2 * M -= 948 (mod 2773).

IX. Security of the Method: Cryptanalytic
Approaches
Since no techniques exist to prove that an encryp-
tion scheme is secure, the only test available is to see
whether anyone can think of a way to break it. The
NBS standard was "certified" this way; seventeen man-
years at IBM were spent fruitlessly trying to break that
scheme. Once a method has successfully resisted such
a concerted attack it may for practical purposes be
considered secure. (Actually there is some controversy
concerning the security of the NBS method [2].)
We show in the next sections that all the obvious
approaches for breaking our system are at least as
difficult as factoring n. While factoring large numbers
is not provably difficult, it is a well-known problem
that has been worked on for the last three hundred
years by many famous mathematicians. Fermat
(1601?-1665) and Legendre (1752-1833) developed
factoring algorithms; some of today's more efficient
algorithms are based on the work of Legendre. As we
shall see in the next section, however, no one has yet
found an algorithm which can factor a 200-digit num-
ber in a reasonable amount of time. We conclude that
our system has already been partially "certified" by
these previous efforts to find efficient factoring algo-
rithms.
In the following sections we consider ways a crypt-
analyst might try to determine the secret decryption
key from the publicly revealed encryption key. We do
not consider ways of protecting the decryption key
from theft; the usual physical security methods should
suffice. (For example, the encryption device could be
a separate device which could also be used to generate
the encryption and decryption keys, such that the
decryption key is never printed out (even for its owner)
but only used to decrypt messages. The device could
erase the decryption key if it was tampered with.)
A. Factoring n
Factoring n would enable an enemy cryptanalyst to
"break" our method. The factors of n enable him to
compute ~,(n) and thus d. Fortunately, factoring a
number seems to be much more difficult than deter-
mining whether it is prime or composite.
A large number of factoring algorithms exist. Knuth
[3, Section 4.5.4] gives an excellent presentation of
many of them. Pollard [9] presents an algorithm which
factors a number n in time 0(n114).
The fastest factoring algorithm known to the au-
thors is due to Richard Schroeppel (unpublished); it
can factor n in approximately
exp(sqrt(ln(n) * In(In(n))))
= I~qrt(ln(ln(n))/ln(n))
= (ln(n))Sqrt(ln(n)lln(ln(n)))
steps (here In denotes the natural logarithm function).
Table I gives the number of operations needed to

factor n with Schroeppel's method, and the time re-
quired if each operation uses one microsecond, for
various lengths of the number n (in decimal digits):
We recommend that n be about 200 digits long.
Longer or shorter lengths can be used depending on
the relative importance of encryption speed and secu-
rity in the application at hand. An 80-digit n provides
moderate security against an attack using current tech-
nology; using 200 digits provides a margin of safety
against future developments. This flexibility to choose
a key-length (and thus a level of security) to suit a
particular application is a feature not found in many of
the previous encryption schemes (such as the NBS
scheme).
B. Computing ~o(n) Without Factoring n
If a cryptanalyst could compute ~0(n) then he could
break the system by computing d as the multiplicative
inverse of e modulo ~p(n) (using the procedure of
Section VII D).
We argue that this approach is no easier than
factoring n since it enables the cryptanalyst to easily
factor n using ~o(n). This approach to factoring n has
not turned out to be practical.
How can n be factored using ~o(n) ? First, (p + q) is
obtained from n and ~o(n) = n - (p + q) + 1. Then
(p - q) is the square root of (p + q)2 _ 4n. Finally, q
is half the difference of (p + q) and (p - q).
Therefore breaking our system by computing ~o(n)
is no easier than breaking our system by factoring n.
(This is why n must be composite; ~o(n) is trivial to
compute if n is prime.)
C. Determining d Without Factoring n or Computing
~(n).
Of course, d should be chosen from a large enough
set so that a direct search for it is unfeasible.
We argue that computing d is no easier for a
cryptanalyst than factoring n , since once d is known n
could be factored easily. This approach to factoring
has also not turned out to be fruitful.
A knowledge of d enables n to be factored as
follows. Once a cryptanalyst knows d he can calculate
e * d - 1, which is a multiple of ~0(n). Miller [6] has
shown that n can be factored using any multiple of
~o(n). Therefore if n is large a cryptanalyst should not
be able to determine d any easier than he can factor n.
A cryptanalyst may hope to find a d ' which is
equivalent to the d secretly held by a user of the
125 Communications February 1978
of Volume 21
the A C M N u m b e r 2
public-key cryptosystem. If such values d ' were com-
mon then a brute-force search could break the system.
However, all such d ' differ by the least c o m m o n
multiple of (p - 1) and (q - 1), and finding one
e n a b l e s n to be factored. (In (3) and (5), ~¢(n) can be
replaced by lcm(p - 1, q - 1).) Finding any such d ' is
therefore as difficult as factoring n .
D. Computing D in Some Other Way
Although this problem of "computing eth roots
modulo n without factoring n " is not a well-known
difficult problem like factoring, we feel reasonably
confident that it is computationally intractable. It may
be possible to prove that any general method of
breaking our scheme yields an efficient factoring algo-
rithm. This would establish that any way of breaking
our scheme must be as difficult as factoring. We have
not been able to prove this conjecture, however.
Our m e t h o d should be certified by having the
above conjecture of intractability withstand a concerted
attempt to disprove it. The reader is challenged to find
a way to " b r e a k " our m e t h o d .
X. Avoiding "Reblocking" when Encrypting a Signed
Message
A signed message may have to be " r e b l o c k e d " for
encryption since the signature n may be larger than
the encryption n (every user has his own n ) . This can
be avoided as follows. A threshold value h is chosen
(say h = 10199) for the public-key cryptosystem. Every
user maintains two public (e, n) pairs, one for encipher-
ing and one for signature-verification, where every
signature n is less than h , and every enciphering n is
greater than h . Reblocking to encipher a signed mes-
sage is then unnecessary; the message is blocked ac-
cording to the transmitter's signature n .
A n o t h e r solution uses a technique given in [4].
Each user has a single (e, n) pair where n is between h
and 2h, where h is a threshold as above. A message is
encoded as a n u m b e r less than h and enciphered as
before, except that if the ciphertext is greater than h ,
it is repeatedly re-enciphered until it is less than h .
Similarly for decryption the ciphertext is repeatedly
deciphered to obtain a value less than h . I f n is near h
re-enciphering will be infrequent. (Infinite looping is
not possible, since at worst a message is enciphered as
itself.)
XI. Conclusions
We have proposed a method for implementing a
public-key cryptosystem whose security rests in part on
the difficulty of factoring large numbers. If the security
of our method proves to be adequate, it permits secure
communications to be established without the use of
126
couriers to carry keys, and it also permits one to "sign"
digitized documents.
The security of this system needs to be examined in
more detail. In particular, the difficulty of factoring
large numbers should be examined very closely. The
reader is urged to find a way to " b r e a k " the system.
Once the method has withstood all attacks for a
sufficient length of time it may be used with a reasona-
ble amount of confidence.
O u r encryption function is the only candidate for a
" t r a p - d o o r one-way p e r m u t a t i o n " known to the au-
thors. It might be desirable to find other examples, to
provide alternative implementations should the secu-
rity of our system turn out someday to be inadequate.
There are surely also m a n y new applications to be
discovered for these functions.
