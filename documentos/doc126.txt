Abstract: The advancements in digital communication technology have made communication
between humans more accessible and instant. However, personal and sensitive information may be
available online through social networks and online services that lack the security measures to protect
this information. Communication systems are vulnerable and can easily be penetrated by malicious
users through social engineering attacks. These attacks aim at tricking individuals or enterprises
into accomplishing actions that benefit attackers or providing them with sensitive data such as social
security number, health records, and passwords. Social engineering is one of the biggest challenges
facing network security because it exploits the natural human tendency to trust. This paper provides
an in-depth survey about the social engineering attacks, their classifications, detection strategies,
and prevention procedures.
Keywords: social engineering attacks; cyber security; phishing; vishing; spear phishing; scams;

1. Introduction
Social engineering attacks are rapidly increasing in today’s networks and are weakening the
cybersecurity chain. They aim at manipulating individuals and enterprises to divulge valuable and
sensitive data in the interest of cyber criminals [1]. Social engineering is challenging the security of all
networks regardless of the robustness of their firewalls, cryptography methods, intrusion detection
systems, and anti-virus software systems. Humans are more likely to trust other humans compared
to computers or technologies. Therefore, they are the weakest link in the security chain. Malicious
activities accomplished through human interactions influence a person psychologically to divulge
confidential information or to break the security procedures [2]. Due to these human interactions, social
engineering attacks are the most powerful attacks because they threaten all systems and networks.
They cannot be prevented using software or hardware solutions as long as people are not trained to
prevent these attacks. Cyber criminals choose these attacks when there is no way to hack a system
with no technical vulnerabilities [3].
According to the U.S. Department of Justice, social engineering attacks are one of the most
dangerous threats over the world. In 2016, the cyber security analyst company Cyence stated that the
United States was the country targeted by the most social engineering attacks and had the highest
attacking cost followed by Germany and Japan. The estimated cost of these attacks in the US was
$121.22 billion. In particular, U.S. companies are highly targeted and impacted by cyber criminals and
hackers from everywhere in the world. These companies handle international significant valuable
data and when these companies are hacked, it highly impacts the worldwide economy and privacy [4].
For instance, Equifax company was hacked for several months and sensitive costumers ‘data were
stolen in 2018. This company is a consumer credit reporting and monitoring agency that aggregates
data of individuals and business consumers to monitor their credit history and prevent frauds. As a

2.2.3. Baiting Attacks
Baiting attacks, also called road apples, are phishing attacks that invite users to click on a link
to get free stuff. They act like trojan horses where the attack is performed by exploiting unsecured
computer materials such as storage media or USB drives containing malware in a coffee shop to be
found by victims. When the victims plug the USB drive into their computers, the drive acts like a real
world trojan horse and attacks the computer. This attack performs malicious actions in the background
without being noticed by the victims.
In [7], the authors described a baiting attack named controller area network (CANDY) to be
launched as a trojan horse in the infotainment system of automotive systems. This attack impacts
the security capabilities of the vehicle by manipulating the communication between the driver and
the vehicle. It is performed by recording the driver’s voice which lets the attacker remotely access
the victim’s vehicle via back door, collect information about the vehicle circulation, and control the
operation of the vehicle.
2.2.4. Tailgating Attacks
Tailgating attacks, also called piggybacking or physical access, consist of accessing an area or
building by following someone who has the security clearance to that place. They allow attackers
access unauthorized buildings. For example, attackers ask a victim to hold the door open because they
forgot their company’ ID card or RFID (radio-frequency identification) card. They can also borrow a
computer or cellphone to perform malicious activities such as installing malware software [14].
For instance, RFID cards attacks are one of the most used attacks to access forbidden spaces
for malicious purposes. Due to their wide utilization and low cost, RFID systems are considered as
the most emerging technology used by companies to control the access to their facilities. Despite
their advantages, they have vulnerabilities that can be exploited to cause serious security issues to
companies. RFID attacks can be performed over several layers of the interconnection system model
(ISO) [28]. For instance, at the physical layer, the RFID devices and the physical interface are targeted
to manipulate an RFID communication. These attacks can cause temporary or permanent damage of
the RFID cards. At the network layer level, the attacker manipulates the RFID network such as the
communication between the RFID entities and data exchange between these entities.
2.2.5. Ransomware Attacks
Ransomware attack is yet another threat that targets individuals and companies. Recently, the FBI
stated that losses due to ransomware attacks were about $1 billion in 2016, which indicates the
immense financial damage a ransomware can do to companies. The ramifications of a ransomware
attack can be more expensive than the ransom itself [28]. Affected companies may suffer the results
of the ransomware attack for years because of loss of business, customers, data, and productivity.
Ransomware attacks restrict and block access to the victim’s data and files by encrypting them [29].
In order to recover these files, the victim is threatened to publish them unless paying a ransom [13].
This payment must be done with Bitcoins, which is an unregulated digital currency that is hard to
track. There are two ways to analyze a ransomware attack: static and dynamic. Static analysis is
performed by high skilled engineers and programming language specialists by developing programs
to analyze and understand the attack in order to stop it or to get back the encrypted files. Dynamic
analysis entails observing the functions of the malware remotely. It requires trusted systems to run
untrusted programs without damaging the systems [29].
A Ransomware attack involves six stages: (1) creating the malware; (2) deployment; (3) installation;
(4) command and control; (5) destruction; and (6) extortion [13]. The malware creation consists of
developing a ransomware or using an existing one to discover any vulnerability in the victim’s system
in order to create a backdoor. The deployment consists of delivering the ransomware by bypassing the
security controls through the created backdoor. The installation consists of running the ransomware

Future Internet 2019, 11, 89

7 of 17

and infecting the system. In the command and control stage, the ransomware is active when the victim
has internet connection to communicate with the command center or it is passive when it is offline.
In the destruction stage, the ransomware starts blocking or encrypting data and freezing screens.
Extortion consists of contacting the victim demanding ransom in exchange to release the blocked files
with a time limit warning. Getting back the files after the victim’s payment is not guaranteed [30,31].
Once a ransomware attack is launched on a computer, the victims have only three choices: (1) paying
the ransom to get back the encrypted files; (2) trying to restore the files from backups if any; or (3) losing
the data after refusing to pay the ransom [32].
2.2.6. Fake Software Attacks
Fake software attacks, also called fake websites, are based on fake websites to make victims
believe they are known and trusted software or websites. The victim enters real login information into
the fake website, which gives the attacker the victim’s credentials to use on the legitimate website, such
as access to online bank accounts. An example of these threats is the tabnabbing attack which consists
of a fake web page that looks like the login page of a popular website usually visited by the victim,
such as online banking, Facebook, or Twitter for example [33]. The victims enter the login details when
focusing on something else. The malicious user exploits the trust the victims have for these websites
and gets access to their credential information [34].
2.2.7. Reverse Social Engineering Attacks
Reverse social engineering attackers claim to solve a network’s problem. This involves three main
steps: causing a problem such as crashing the network; advertising that the attacker is the only person
to fix that problem; solving the problem while getting the desired information and leaving without
being detected [18].
2.2.8. Pop-Up Windows
Pop-up window attacks refer to windows appearing on the victim’s screen informing the
connection is lost [35]. The user reacts by re-entering the login information, which runs a malicious
program already installed with the window appearance. This program remotely forwards back the
login information to the attacker. For instance, pop-ups can be alert messages showing up randomly
for online advertising to lure the victim in clicking on that window. Pop-ups also can be fake messages
alerting about a virus detection in the victim’s computer. The pop up will prompt the victim to
download and install the suggested anti-virus software to protect the computer. They can also be fake
alerts stating that the computer storage is full and that it needs to be scanned and cleaned to save
more space [35]. The victim panics and reacts quickly in order to fix the problem, which activates the
malware software carried in the pop-up window.
2.2.9. Phone/Email Scams Attacks
For this type of attacks, the attacker contacts the victim via phone or email seeking specific
information or promising a prize or free merchandise. They aim at influencing the victim to break the
security rules or to provide personal information. Moreover, cellphone-based attacks can be performed
via calls and via short messaging services (SMS) or text messages, which are known as SMSishing
attacks [35]. SMSishing attacks consist of sending fraudulent messages and texts via cell phones to
victims to influence them. They are similar to phishing attacks but they are performed in different
ways. The efficiency of the SMSishing attacks resides in the fact that victims can carry their cellphones
anywhere and anytime. A received text message can include a malware even if it was sent from trusted
and known transmitter. The malware works as a background process installing backdoors for attackers
to have access to information such as contact list, messages, personal email, photos, notes, applications,
and calendar. The scammer can install a root kit to control the cellphone completely [20].

2.2.10. Robocalls Attacks
Robocall attacks have recently emerged as massive calls coming from computers to targeted
persons with known phone numbers. They target cellphones, residential, and work phones. A robocall
is a device or computer program that automatically dials a list of phone numbers to deliver prerecorded
messages. It is mainly based on voice over the internet protocol (VoIP) to ensure several VoIP functions
such as interactive voice response and text to speech [36]. These calls can be about offering or selling
services or solving problems. Helping to solve tax problems is a very known example of attack that
has risen in intensity in recent years. In general, when a victim answers the call, the phone number is
stored in the attacker’s database. Even after blocking these calls, attackers’ systems call from other
numbers. Robocall attacks have become a serious problem in the USA and other countries. The only
way for people to stop these calls is by not answering unknown phone numbers.
2.2.11. Other Attacks
There are many other types of attacks that can be summarized as follows:

•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Impersonation on Help Desk attacks: the attacker pretends to be someone with authority or a
company’s employee and calling the help desk requesting information or services.
Dumpster Diving attacks: consist of gathering sensitive documents from company’s trash or
discarded equipment such as old computer materials, drives, CDs, and DVDs [37].
Quid Pro Quo attacks: baiting attacks offering free services to seduce the victim. They require an
exchange of information in return for a service or product [37].
Diversion Theft attacks: consist of misdirecting a transport company to deliver a courier or
package to the desired location.
Shoulder surfing attacks: consist of watching the victim while entering passwords or
sensitive information.
Stealing important documents attacks: consist of stealing files from someone’s desk for
personal interests.
Online social engineering attacks: the attacker pretends to be the network administrator for a
company and asks for usernames and passwords.
Pharming attacks: the attacker steals the traffic coming from a specific website by redirecting it to
another fake website in order to get the carried information [38]. This attack works by hacking
the domain name system (DNS) server and exploiting any vulnerabilities to change the internet
protocol (IP) address of the host machine and the server.

3. Prevention Techniques
Social engineering attacks represent significant security risks and addressing these attacks should
be part of the risk management strategy of companies and organizations [39]. Companies should
make a commitment to the security awareness culture among their employees. In order to detect and
prevent these attacks, a number of techniques have been proposed. A list of defense procedures for
social-engineering attacks include: encouraging security education and training, increasing social
awareness of social-engineering attacks, providing the required tools to detect and avoid these attacks,
learning how to keep confidential information safe, reporting any suspected activity to the security
service, organizing security orientations for new employees, and advertising attacks’ risks to all
employees by forwarding sensitization emails and known fraudulent emails [40].
In order to detect attacks via phone calls, it is necessary to verify the source of calls using a
recording contacts’ list, being aware of unexpected and unsolicited calls, asking to call back, or asking
questions with private answers to check the caller’s identity. The most effective way to stop these
attacks is by not answering these calls. For help desk attacks, assigning PINs to known callers prevents
malicious calls [41]. The help desk is required to stick to the scope while performing a call request.
For email-based attacks, some companies use the honeypot email addresses, also called spamtraps,

Future Internet 2019, 11, 89

9 of 17

to collect and publish the spams to employees. When an email is sent from one of the spamtraps
list, the server considers it as malicious and bans it temporarily. Other procedures that can be done
include: verifying emails’ sources before clicking on a link or opening an attachment, examining
the emails header, calling the known sender if suspicious, and discarding emails with quick rich or
prize-winning announcements.
For phishing attacks, anti-phishing tools have been proposed to blacklist and block phishing
websites. Examples of these tools are McAfee anti-phishing filter, Microsoft phishing filter, and
Web sense [42,43]. In [44], the authors proposed to teach students how the spear phishing attack is
performed by learning by doing. They developed a framework in which students learn how phishing
emails work by performing attacks on a virtual company. After gathering all the possible information
from the company’s website, the students launched phishing emails to simulated employees and then
scanned all the received emails to decide about their nature.
In [45], the authors proposed a detection technique based on machine learning algorithms.
This technique is based on unsupervised learning, in which there is no past knowledge about the
observed attacks. The authors compared the performance of six machine learning algorithms for
detecting phishing attacks in terms of speed, reliability, and accuracy: support vector machine, biased
support vector machine, artificial neural networks, scaled conjugate gradient, and self-organizing map.
They showed that the support vector machine algorithm achieves better results compared to the other
algorithms. In [22], the authors proposed a method to detect the credential spear phishing attacks in
enterprise sittings. The proposed detection method, called anomaly detection (DAS), performs by
analyzing the potential characteristics to the spear phishing attacks in order to derive a number of
features used by the attacker. It is a non-parametric anomaly scoring method used for ranking alerts.
For tailgating attacks, they may be prevented by training employees to never give access to
someone without badge with no exceptions and requiring locks and IDs for all employees [35].
For shoulder surfing attacks, individuals are required to be more aware of what is around them,
including persons or cameras when they enter sensitive information. For dumpster diving attacks,
sensitive discarded documents and materials must be completely destroyed using shredders, memory
devices must be secured or erased, and important files must be locked securely and not left for
easy access.
Trojan-based attacks may be prevented by refusing to let someone use other people personal or
work computers, using an antivirus for USB scanning before opening it and following the antivirus
instructions and warning, examining any unexpected mailing packages, and not picking up and using
found digital medias. To prevent fake software attacks, individuals need to check carefully the screen
and verify if the software window is legitimate as real websites have always something special than
the fake ones. Anti-virus may be limited by human unawareness; they may catch these attacks and
send warnings, which most users ignore by closing the window and move on. Other preventions can
be considered including verifying if the website has the https logo, not click before examining the URL,
and update regularly the computer’s operating system and security software.
Some security organizations encourage companies to adopt the defense in depth strategy to
monitor their network and prepared themselves for possible attacks while neglecting the human
aspect. In [46], the authors proposed to identify the requirements of an anti-social engineering attacks
framework capable of analyzing and mitigating attack risks. They developed a new layered defense
technique named Social Engineering Centered Risk Assessment (SERA). SERA starts by identifying
the critical assets to evaluate the company’s information for the next step. Then, each asset is placed in
a container and the corresponding social engineering attack vectors are identified. Probability of attack
realization is driven by local security experts and the risk analysis is obtained.
In [47], the authors proposed a flow whitelisting approach to enhance the network security inside
companies. The flow whitelisting approach aims at identifying legitimate traffic from malicious traffic
coming to the company’s network. Four properties are used to identify these whitelists: address of the
client, address of the server, port number of the server, and the protocol used for the traffic transport.

Future Internet 2019, 11, 89

10 of 17

The proposed approach is performed by capturing the network’s traffic at a predefined period of
time and aggregating that traffic into flows when that traffic is identified as legitimate. It is based on
learning to distinguish legitimate traffic from malicious traffic and generating alarms in case of an
observed malicious traffic. In [34], the authors proposed a new approach called TabShots to distinguish
between legitimate pages from malicious pages. The TabShots is an extension installed in the browser
that compares the appearance of the webpages and highlights any observed changes to excite the
attention of the user before proceeding.
In [48], the authors discussed the problem of formalizing actions that are a result of social
engineering attacks. They proposed to model these actions through probabilities and graphical
models such as Bayesian models. They analyzed the user’s profile to estimate its vulnerabilities
and psychological features. Estimating the protection of a user profile against an attack is obtained
through four elements: psychological features (F), critical vulnerabilities (V), attack’s actions (A), and
user’s accountability at successful attacks (C). In [49], the authors proposed to analyze the human’s
behaviors and perceptions to cope with social engineering attacks. They aim at understanding human
weaknesses in being deceived easily by attackers and defining factors and features that influence the
human abilities to detect attacks. They also aim at identifying vulnerable users by building a user
profile that focuses on security education and training programs.
In [50], the authors evaluated the susceptibility to cybersecurity attacks in cooperative
organizations in order to assess the consciousness of social engineering attacks of employees.
By performing an attack against the organization based on the available information on the
organization’s website, employees reacted to the attack in different ways with different awareness
degrees. These results were then benchmarked to establish the organization awareness in terms of
ignoring the attack and being tricked or recognizing the attack and appropriately responding to it.
Attack victims were then directed to intensive training. In [51], a social engineering awareness program
(SEAP) was developed for schools aiming at increasing students’ awareness by providing significant
education and training in early age.
4. Mitigation Techniques
Human-based attacks are sophisticated and hard to detect, making their mitigation necessary.
Mitigating techniques for social engineering attacks aim at decreasing the attacks’ impact on the
individuals or the companies [52]. They aim at saving what can be saved after a human is already
attacked or a company’s system is already hacked. The cyber security entity needs to minimize the
loss as much as possible by defining security actions in case of emergency. For instance, building
a corporate security culture among the company’s employees is a mitigation technique against the
attacks targeting companies or groups of individuals [53]. This positive culture helps the attack’s
victim not feel ashamed of being manipulated as the social engineer exploits the misplaced trust and
not because the victim is unintelligent or foolish.
Being aware of this culture enhances the security responsibilities by reporting all the attacks to the
technical staff as soon as possible in order to prevent more damage. This mitigation technique saves
valuable time in responding to an attack and stopping the spread of the attack into the company’s
network. Another mitigation technique for attacks related to calls or emails informing someone of
a lottery win is spreading awareness about the psychological triggers of social engineering attacks.
If individuals receive this kind of information, they should be aware that they cannot win a lottery or
prize they did never entered, and no one gives away a fortune to them by an email or as a donation.
Recognizing that can stop people from replying to the attacker with the requested data.
For attacks related to emails or link clicks, software vendors become more aware of the
social engineering treats by building strong products with security measures [54]. These software
products are very challenging for cyber criminals to penetrate them. Due to these implemented
security measures, the attacker cannot get enough data even if a victim is fooled by the attack [55].
The human-based mitigation techniques are based on human judgments in determining if an activity

Future Internet 2019, 11, 89

11 of 17

is legitimate or malicious. They involve two approaches: (1) auditing and policy; (2) education,
training, and awareness (ETA). The auditing and policy approach refers to a number of security rules
and procedures implemented in companies to help employees detect social engineering attacks [56].
These security rules are controlled by policies in order to guide employees to decide about the state
of a suspected activity. The policy approach can be considered as a defense strategy to control the
employee’s reaction while under social engineering attack. The education, training, and awareness
approaches refer to the effective application of the auditing and policy approach. They aim at ensuring
the deployment of the defined security policies and procedures by the organization. In [57], the authors
proposed to introduce these ETA techniques to new employees as a security orientation in order to
provide them with the organization prerequisites toward a secure company.
Human-based mitigation techniques are a must for companies to mitigate the social engineering
attacks and minimize their impacts in exploiting employees’ weaknesses and vulnerabilities. They are
mainly related to the effective in decision making and acting to classify an activity as malicious and act
as necessary. However, human decisions are relative and thus not efficient as the human judgment is
subjective even with strong awareness of social engineering attacks [58]. Technology-based mitigation
techniques are required to enhance the accuracy of the human-based mitigation techniques. There are
four technology-based mitigation techniques: biometrics, sensors, artificial intelligence, and social
honeypot. Biometrics-based techniques aim at counteracting physical impersonation attacks, which
refer to impersonating a company’s employee by creating a fake profile with his/her identity [59].
Biometrics distinguish real employees from fake profiles through their biological traits. These
unique traits can be fingerprint, facial recognition, eye print, and voice. Biometrics-based techniques
can be effective only if the malicious user is subjected to biometric tests. Sensor-based technique
entails using sensors to identify individuals. For instance, the authors of [60] proposed a prototype
based on inter-body communication to check employees using door systems or specific uniforms.
The prototype checks the transmitted signal from the system and compares it to the signal used by
the genuine uniform. Artificial intelligence-based techniques aim at enhancing the human-based
mitigation strategies by adding an additional security layer. As adaptive learning systems, artificial
intelligence systems are able to learn, adapt, and change their parameters according to the situation.
In [61], a multitier phishing detection and filtering technique was proposed to extract and analyze
email features in order to filter them. In [62], the authors proposed a neuro-fuzzy-based technique to
mitigate phishing attacks in real time and protect online transactions.
As previously mentioned, ransomware attacks are one of the security risks a company or a user
can face. They consider the human as the main target instead of devices or systems, which makes them
hard to identify. In [60], the authors focused on mobile ransomware by proposing a new detection
technique called HelDroid. According to the authors, this technique efficiently detects any possible
ransom activity even if it was never previously experienced. HelDroid was integrated in the cellphones
to monitor all the used applications. The technique verifies and scans their activities before proceeding
with the utilization or even before the application’s installation starts. The authors of [63] focused
on designing advanced operation systems and devices resistant to ransomware as a great future
interest to deal with these attacks. In [64], the authors proposed an early warning detection system
called CryptoDrop that is able to alert the employee in case of suspicious activity on the user data.
The CryptoDrop system analyzes several common behavior indicators related to ransomware attacks.
It detects the attack rapidly and stops the malicious software with a low data loss.
In [65], the authors proposed several steps to follow to mitigate and handle ransomware attacks.
These steps are: (1) preparation; (2) detection; (3) containment; (4) eradication; and (5) recovery. In the
preparation step, a company’s security staff must eliminate all the vulnerabilities so that the hacker
cannot penetrate the company’s system. This step is considered as a defense strategy to stop the
ransomware from spreading throughout the system and taking sensitive data. The preparation step
requires frequent synchronization to protect the company’s backups as the hacker destroys all the files
(regular files and backup files) before asking for ransom to put the company at risk. These backups

Future Internet 2019, 11, 89

12 of 17

must be stored somewhere else than in the company’s data centers (cloud and network shared storage),
such as offline storage. Moreover, the preparation step requires an incident response to be developed
for when an attack occurs. The incident response plan specifies what everyone needs to do when an
attack is underway in order to effectively and quickly react to an attack. This plan can be ensured by
regular trainings to the employees that teach them how to effectively respond to these attacks.
In the detection step, a ransomware attack is detected and blocked using CryptoWall and Locky
traffic. When a ransomware is detected earlier, the user can stop it or at least minimize its damage.
The quick detection of the ransomware allows companies and individuals contain the situation and act
accordingly when the attack is already running. The CryptoWall and Locky traffic are tools integrated
in the intrusion detection systems (IDS) and used by companies to limit the attack’s propagation over
the company’s network. The containment step aims at containing the attack on only few devices that
are already affected by the attack in order to limit locally the attack. It is mainly based on an endpoint
protection system, which is able to kill the process of the attack’s execution and deactivate the network
connectivity. As a result, the attacker is not able to encrypt the files [66]. The eradication step consists
of cleaning the damage resulted once the ransomware attack is contained and identified. It performs
by eradicating the attack from the network and replacing infected machines and devices instead of
cleaning them in order to get away of any hidden malicious files on the devices.
The last step consists of recovering any damaged or lost files and restoring them from backups
after replacing systems and machines. It requires some downtime to run the backup processes and
to investigate how the ransomware penetrated the system. These five mitigation steps can be used
to handle any other social engineering attacks. They represent the very essential stages a company
must have. Moreover, the defense success against any type of social engineering attacks depends on
how the individual or the company is prepared [31]. The level to preparation determines the ability to
prevent, detect, mitigate, and contain any suspicious activity.
5. Comparison
Social engineering attacks target individuals and even the most complex and secure organizations.
Countermeasures and defense strategies aim at protecting them against the social engineering attacks.
These techniques can be considered as the minimum an organization or a company should have
to defend themselves from the most common social engineering attacks. A company can have
one or more mechanisms installed in the company’s system. Table 1 compares the human-based
and computer-based techniques while Table 2 compares the computer-based countermeasures and
mitigation techniques.

Through analyzing and comparing these techniques, one can conclude that artificial

engineering attacks. In addition, combining two or more defense techniques can ensure better
protection. In addition, the level of preparation determines the ability to prevent, detect, mitigate, and
contain any suspicious activity.

6. Challenges and Future Directions
Companies are investing large amounts of money and resources to establish effective strategies
against social engineering attacks [67,68]. However, existing detection methods have fundamental
limitations and countermeasures are inefficient in coping with the ever-growing number of
social engineering attacks. Human-based techniques are limited by humans’ subjective decisions.
Technology-based techniques can be also limited as the technological vulnerabilities may be exploited.
These attacks are evolving day after day and attackers are becoming smarter and stronger. Thus, there
is a great need for more effective detection and countermeasure techniques to detect and minimize the
impact of these attacks.
Because humans are a challenge for the security of any network, it important to develop training
programs for employees and most importantly for K-12 students. Training students at early age can
minimize the number of victims in the future. Moreover, countries have to invest in cyber security
education [69,70]. Currently, there is a handful of universities in the United States of America that
provide quality programs in cybersecurity. Thus, there are numerous jobs in this cyber-security field
that are not filled because of the lack of graduates.

7. Conclusions
In this paper, we provided an overview of social engineering attacks, existing detection techniques,
and current countermeasure methods. Unfortunately, these attacks cannot be stopped using only
technology and a robust security system can be easily overcome by a social engineer with no security
knowledge. Social engineering attacks have been increasing in intensity and number and are causing
emotional and financial damage to people and companies. Therefore, there is a great need for novel
