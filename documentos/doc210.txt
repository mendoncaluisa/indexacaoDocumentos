 Abstract: In this research, we propose an unsupervised method for segmentation and edge extraction
 of color images on the HSV space. This approach is composed of two different phases in which are
 applied two metaheuristic algorithms, respectively the Firefly (FA) and the Artificial Bee Colony
 (ABC) algorithms. In the first phase, we performed a pixel-based segmentation on each color channel,
 applying the FA algorithm and the Gaussian Mixture Model. The FA algorithm automatically detects
 the number of clusters, given by histogram maxima of each single-band image. The detected maxima
 define the initial means for the parameter estimation of the GMM. Applying the Bayes’ rule, the
 posterior probabilities of the GMM can be used for assigning pixels to clusters. After processing
 each color channel, we recombined the segmented components in the final multichannel image. A
 further reduction in the resultant cluster colors is obtained using the inner product as a similarity
 index. In the second phase, once we have assigned all pixels to the corresponding classes of the HSV
 space, we carry out the second step with a region-based segmentation applied to the corresponding
 grayscale image. For this purpose, the bioinspired Artificial Bee Colony algorithm is performed for
 edge extraction.

 1. Introduction
 Image segmentation is the decomposition of an image into meaningful structures,
 which is a key step in image processing, with the main purpose of facilitating tasks at
 higher levels, such as object detection, recognition and classification, in passing from image
 processing to image analysis and image understanding [1]. The basic goal of any image
 segmentation process is to subdivide an image into components belonging to different ob
jects or to different parts of an object. Theoretically, pixels derived by the same component
 should have similar properties, forming a connected region [2]. During recent decades,
 manycolor segmentation methods have been proposed in the literature; for an in-depth
 overview, refer to [3–5]. A general and broad classification of segmentation image tech
niques is reported in [6], where a low-level taxonomy is introduced based on distinguishing
 segmentation methods into spatially guided and spatially blind, where the former perform
 the spatial arrangement of pixels, unlike the second ones.
 Color segmentation techniques can also be divided into three main categories: feature
space-based methods, image-domain-based methods and physics-based methods [7]. In
 the first class, cluster segments are generated in such a way that they are homogeneous
 with respect to the characteristics of the feature space, such as intensity level, color or
 texture. After mapping pixels into a color space, they are allocated in each cluster based
 on their features, recurring to predefined similarity criteria. Generally, feature-space
 techniques are spatially blind; they ignore the spatial distribution of pixel colors. Histogram
 thresholding techniques can be ascribed to this category. In thresholding techniques, pixels
 are partitioned according to their intensity or color levels, recurring to a global thresholding

 or multiple thresholds [8,9]. Histograms are composed of relatively separated parts of
 intensities, each representing an object of the image. In partitional clustering, segmentation
 is carried out by partitioning the data into a defined number of clusters; K-means and
 Fuzzy C-Means algorithms belong to this class [10,11]. Image data can be grouped in a
 one-dimensional or three-dimensional space, depending on whether it is a grayscale or a
 color image [12]. In our approach, it is not necessary to predefine the number of clusters, as
 they will be automatically determined.
 Beside homogeneity, a second basic property of segmented regions must be the spatial
 compactness. Generally, feature-space-based techniques do not take into account the spatial
 locations of pixels, as they provide a global description of the image. On the contrary,
 image-domain-based techniques are spatially guided, therefore pixels are clustered based
 on their spatial relationships, assuming that points of the same object are usually nearby.
 Region-based, energy-based and edge-based algorithms are included in this class, with
 the aim to form homogenous and compact groups of pixels from the geometrical point of
 view. The hierarchical clustering methods are included into this category as well, since they
 produce image subdivision as nested series of partitions based on a criterion for splitting
 or merging clusters attempting to group pixels into homogenous regions [13,14]. In fact,
 superpixel algorithms strongly reduce the juxtaposition between these two categories.
 Recently, Ren and Malik [15] introduced a novel technique based on superpixels that
 segments an image into regions by considering their proximity and similarity measures
 defined using image features. Superpixels replace the rigid pixel structure by delineating
 regions formed by groups of pixels that look similar, making other processing tasks simpler
 than using single image pixels.
 Principally, color segmentation techniques belonging to the two aforementioned cate
gories are based on monochrome segmentation approaches, operating in a specific three
dimensional color space. In most cases, they are a sort of dimensional extension of grayscale
 image methods. On the other hand, the methodologies which are part of the third category
 are diversified according to the physical models applied for describing light interaction
 with materials. Consequently, they do not correspond to any monochromic segmentation
 methods. In color image processing, physical models aim at eliminating the effect of high
lights and shadowing, [16]. The Healey’s reflection model was one of the first attempts at
 analyzing the geometrical scene and the physical nature of materials [17].
 In the present work, we apply a feature-space-based method in which pixels are
 identified by the three components of a preselected color space [18]. Consequently, it is very
 important to define which color space is going to be used because the similarity measure
 will be defined within it. The quality of segmentation may depend considerably on the
 employed color space [19]. By using a suitable color space, some segmentation techniques
 for monochrome images can be extended to segment color images ensuring reliable results.
 Furthermore, we need to keep in mind that segmentation of color images frequently is
 viewed as an ill-defined problem, meaning that there are multiple acceptable solutions, due
 to its intrinsically subjective nature.
 This paperisstructured as follows: Section 2 is composedoftwoparts, theintroduction
 of the feature-space-based color segmentation method in Section 2.1 and the implemented
 region-based method for edge extraction in Section 2.2; Section 3 includes the results
 achieved applying the two proposed methodologies, respectively, in Sections 3.1 and 3.2.
 Finally, we present the conclusion in Section 4.
 2. Materials and Methods
 2.1. Color Image Segmentation Method
 In this work, a monochromatic-based method was implemented, starting with image
 decomposition into three different components. After that, each component is processed
 separately, and finally, the individually achieved results are recombined together [20].
 Regarding the selection of color space, we opted for the HSV. In fact, RGB color space is
 adequate for displaying images but not for image processing, because intensity is not decou

 pled by chromaticity, hence RGB color space does not produce satisfactory segmentation
 results [21].
 As for the HSV space, we need to clarify that hue is the chromatic feature describing
 a pure color (red, yellow, etc.), saturation quantifies the amount of gray in a particular
 color, and generally if saturation appears as a range from 0 to 1, 0 represents gray color
 whereas 1 is a primary color. Value is the intensity or brightness of the color, where 0 is
 completely black, and 1 is the brightest. The hue and saturation, or alternatively, intensity,
 components emulate the human perception of color. More precisely, hue is the dominant
 wavelength, whereas saturation is its purity, or more specifically, the inverse of the amount
 of white light contained in the color. The value component is apart from chromaticity, so it
 is decoupled from hue and saturation.
 After defining the color space, an illumination equalization was performed, applying
 a Gaussian blurring to the value channel of the image with standard deviation sigma equal
 to 1.5; this gives us a local average for the illumination. We have to keep in mind that
 color representation is sensitive to illumination, so two colors with the same chromaticity
 can be recognized as different if they have different lighting intensity. This fact makes
 the clustering processes inefficient, because pixels from the same class but with different
 illumination can be identified as pixels from separate classes.
 After finishing this preprocessing step, we proceeded to a histogram-based segmen
tation approach applied to each color channel, which uses a metaheuristic algorithm to
 automatically define the number of clusters and the histogram maxima [22–25]. Meta
heuristic algorithms are a class of approximate methods that allow us to discover possible
 solutions by exploring a search space in order to find near-optimal solutions. They are
 iterative processes developed to search for a solution that is good enough in a time that
 is small enough [26]. These algorithms are frequently nature-inspired, and they have the
 advantages of finding global optima due to the action of multiple search agents which are
 randomly generated [27]. The solution of an optimization problem with a metaheuristic
 algorithm implies an initialization step generating one or more random solutions. In each
 iteration step, the current solution is then changed by a new one, created by search opera
tors, with a global optimization approach composed by two schemes: the exploitation of
 newsolutions with the goal of improving the quality of solutions and the exploration of
 the entire search space to prevent the selection of local optima.
 In searching maxima of histogram distributions, we suggest the use of this class of
 optimization algorithms because they guarantee an enhancement of convergence into
 global optima despite the presence of numerous local maxima, thanks to the simultaneous
 action of multiple agents moving randomly all around the research space, [28,29]. To this
 end, we applied the Firefly Algorithm that employs fireflies as search agents, making use
 of their idealized flashing characteristics to locate the most significant peaks of grayscale
 histogram for each component [30,31].
 Subsequently, the detected maxima are used as initial values of cluster means for
 the parameter estimation of a Gaussian Mixture Model [32]. The probability density
 function of a Gaussian Mixture Model is expressed as a weighted sum of Gaussian density
 functions, whose parameters are evaluated applying the Expectation-Maximization (EM)
 technique [33]. The coefficients of the linear combination of Gaussians can be seen as
 prior probabilities of each component, while the posterior probabilities, derived by the
 Bayes rule, can be used for assigning pixels to clusters without recurring to a thresholding
 process. The Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) is a parametric probability density function
 represented as a weighted sum of Gaussian component densities. The GMM parameters
 are estimated from data using the iterative Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm. As
 weknow, a univariate Gaussian density distribution is expressed by:
 p x , 2 =Nx , 2 = 1
 2 exp (x )2
 2 2

 where Nx , 2 representstheGaussian ornormal distribution of mean and standard
 deviation . A Gaussian mixture model is a weighted sum of K components of Gaussian
 densities, analytically given by:
 p(x) = K
 k=1 kNx k, 2
 k
 (2)
 Equation (2) represents a linear superposition of Gaussian probability densities and
 the mixing coefficients k indicates the weight of each distribution. After the initialization
 phase, the Gaussian parameters k, 2
 k and the coefficients k of the linear combination are
 evaluated using the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm. At each iteration, the EM
 algorithm computes the responsibilities k, so defined:
 k(x) = p(kx) = 
kNx k, 2
 k
 K
 i=1 iNx i , 2

 (3)
 k(x) represents the posterior probability of a given intensity x to belong to the k-th
 cluster, according to the Bayes rule. In short, the responsibilities estimate the grades of
 membership indicating the degree to which data points belong to each cluster. Conse
quently, the assignment of pixels of a given gray level xi to the cluster k is performed by
 means of the evaluation of the maximum value of responsibilities as k varies, given that, by
 definition, k(xi) indicates the probability of the k-th GMM’s component to have generated
 the value xi.
 The issues of the segmentation process applied to each color channel are obtained
 independently, then they are recombined together to compose the final segmented color
 image. After that, it performs a reduction in the number of distinct colors recurring to
 the parallelism of vectors represented in HSV space. In order to do so, we would like to
 reiterate the fundamental laws of colorimetry, that state [34]:
 1.
 Anycolor canbedefinedbythreevaluesandthecombinationofthethreecomponents
 is unique;
 2.
 3.
 Twocolors are equivalent after multiplying or dividing the three components by the
 same number;
 The luminance of a mixture of colors is equal to the sum of the luminance of each color.
 According to the second statement, we have chosen the cross product to identify
 parallel vectors in the HSV space. Indeed, if two vectors have the same direction, or
 equivalently if they are linearly dependent, their cross product is zero. In this context, if
 the cross product is approximately null it implies that colors are very similar, so they can
 be considered as belonging to the same class.
 At the end of the process, the performance of a clustering algorithm must be estimated.
 The academic literature in this field has suggested several performance metrics to assess the
 validity of cluster partitions [35,36]. Basically, three different techniques are implemented
 for evaluating the efficiency of clustering algorithms: external criteria, internal criteria and
 relative criteria [37]. The external validity methods evaluate the clustering results based
 on their comparison to an externally known result, such as manual image segmentation
 performed by human users. The internal measures estimate the goodness of a clustering
 process without considering external information but using the data set itself. Finally, rela
tive clustering validation evaluates the clustering structure by varying different parameter
 values for the same algorithm (for example changing the number of clusters).
 In this work, the algorithm efficiency is computed through an internal clustering
 validation approach referring to the mean-squared error (MSE) [38]. Usually, MSE is used
 for assessing distortion between the original image and resulted image. For color images,
 the formula is extended to include the three components:
 MSE = 1
 p
 k=1 
n
 i=1 
m
 j=1 I(i, j,k) I(i, j,k) 2
 (4)
 nmp
J. Imaging 2022, 8, 6

 where I(i, j,k), I(i, j,k) are, respectively, the original and the segmented image, p is the
 number of the image components (p = 3 for color spaces), and nm is the size of each
 component. A low MSE value means that the predicted values are close to the real values,
 practically, the RMSE will be used, defined by: RMSE = MSE. This RMSE depends on
 the orders of magnitude of the observed values. Therefore, it can vary significantly from
 one application to the next. To resolve this problem, we could consider the relative absolute
 error (RAE) defined as follows:
 RAE = 1
 nmp
 p
 k=1 
n
 i=1 
m
 j=1
 I(i, j, k) 
I(i, j, k)
 I(i, j, k)
 (5)
 Small values of validation indices imply that the estimated image is close to the
 initial one.
 2.2. Edge Extraction Applying Artificial Bee Colony Algorithm
 After the color segmentation process, we proceed to a region-based segmentation of
 the corresponding gray image in order to extract edges of homogenous components. The
 f
 irst step in region growing is to select a set of seed points. The region begins to grow from
 the location of these seeds. In the present work, the selection of initial seed points was
 achieved through the Artificial Bee Colony algorithm.
 The ABCalgorithm is a swarm-based metaheuristic algorithm that was introduced by
 Karaboga in 2005 [39] for optimizing numerical problems. It was inspired by the intelligent
 foraging behavior of honeybees in nature. The algorithm is specifically based on the
 model for the foraging behavior of honeybee colonies [40,41]. In the ABC algorithm, the
 colony of artificial bees consists of three groups: employed bees, onlookers and scouts [25].
 Employed bees are those who have discovered a food source. The employed bee whose
 food source is abandoned becomes a scout bee, starting new random research around the
 hive. The exchange of information among bees is the most important occurrence in the
 formation of collective knowledge. Communication among bees related to the quality of
 food sources takes place in the dancing area of the hive; this dance is called waggle dance.
 After localizing a source, employed bees share nectar and position information of the food
 sources with onlooker bees executing the waggle dance. An onlooker bee evaluates nectar
 information taken from employed bees and decides to employ herself at the most profitable
 source, with a probability related to the nectar amount [42]. In this context we have adapted
 the ABC method, considering as food sources the areas of the gray image with pixels not
 yet assigned to any cluster. Their fruitfulness is greater the greater their extension. The
 onlooker bees come to the aid of the employed bees in a number proportional to the size
 of the identified food source and to the number of pixels belonging to it not yet grouped
 together into any homogeneous region.

 3.1. Results of the Color Image Segmentation Method
 As aninitial test image, we have considered the BSD image #295087 extracted by the
 Berkeley Segmentation Dataset BSDS500. The original image contains 61,258 unique colors
 (Figure 1).
 During the segmentation of the hue component, the FA algorithm identified four
 different clusters of intensities 16, 35, 124, 147, respectively, and the final outcome is shown
 in Figure 2. As we can see, in the original image two predominant hues appear, the
 f
 irst ranging from ocher to dark brown and the second one is due to the blue sky of the
 background. The validation of the grayscale segmentation was performed by using the
 Root-Mean-Square Error (RMSE) and the Normalized Correlation Coefficient (NK) [43–45].
 For the hue component we have obtained RMSE = 0.0247 and NK = 0.98.

As previously asserted, the variability in adequate solutions for image segmentation
 is an intrinsic and unavoidable feature, primarily due to the differences in the level of
 attention, the degree of detail perceived by one human observer compared to another, and
 the type of represented objects in which the user is interested. However, when pixel colors
 are projected onto three components, color information are widely scattered, and therefore,
 one of the drawbacks of color image processing is how to employ this great amount of
 information. To address this, we performed a color reduction relating to the evaluation
 of the inner product among vectors in the HSV space. Figure 6 allows us to compare the
 segmented images after doing cluster reduction. Iteratively applying the procedure, at first
 we obtained a reduction of 34%, passing from an initial 132 clusters to 87, and then of a
 further 34.4% with respect to the previous one, reducing the colors to 57 and finally to 37

 line segment determine the positions of unemployed bees during their flights. Initially,
 the paths will be confined inside the image space, so as not to go beyond edges. If along
 the path a scout bee finds a food source, which is a zone with unclassified pixels, the
 growing process will be activated starting from the actual position, otherwise the bee keeps
 going undisturbed. Once the region with uniform gray intensity is outlined, its edges are
 extracted and the bounded box of boundaries is determined (Figure 14).

Concerning the spatial segmentation, the application of the probabilistic ABC algo
rithm carries out boundaries of segmented regions in a fast way. The erratic motion of
 scout bees makes it possible to detect edges even if the size of the regions is very small.
 This is due to the local search activated by onlookers rushing to scouts’ aid that makes
 the research more effective and detailed. In this context, the region-based approach is
 performed on the segmented grayscale image rather than on the color one. This is due to a
 limitation of the method hereby applied, which will have to be overcome in future research.
 While Balasubramanian et al. [46] applied the region-growing method on color images
 with a dynamic color gradient thresholding, in this research, the choice of operating with
 grayscale images is crucial for the application of the ABC metaheuristic algorithm in image
 processing, which is also one of the aims of the present work.
